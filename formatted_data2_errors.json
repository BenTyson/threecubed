And if yes, what would the bad ones look like? So we know when we are in trouble or not. Are some also from this earth?",
            "Answer": "You are already familiar with the greys. There are tall ones and short ones. Most are benevolent. Most ET/NHI are humanoid. Some are also human-looking like us with their own culture, likes, dislikes, emotions etc. Just picture it like people from another country who are simply more ahead. They can make mistakes too. There are \"divine\" or \"higher beings\" beyond physicality, but these are rare and they do not interfere much unless they must alter the timeline to set things back on course for \"ultimate reintegration\" with the GCS. I've communicated with said beings only once or twice directly as sustaining telepathic communication with them is absurdly draining. As for the bad ones - some of them actually look human and there's a certain tracking with rep.... that I am now allowed to fully describe. What you need to know is that you do not need to be afraid of them because they are not anywhere near as powerful as \"the good ones.\" Some are from earth/living here, yes.",

            "Question": "Re. The ALL-Power; ALL-Singularity; Grand Central Cortex; the real 'God.'",
            "Answer": "Understanding this fully would require some basic grasp on quantum mechanics, spacetime, and how relativity works. Assuming you have some fundamental understanding, I will start with the basics—each of which, can be expanded into articles of their own.\n1 - There are multiple universes (I do not know the exact number), which would appear to be nearly infinite to our calculations. Each of them, like planets orbiting a central star or supermassive black hole such as SGR#A, are 'connected' to a 'grand central singularity.'\n2 - The GCS is in a 'hyperspace between hyperspaces'—it is quite literally at the CENTER OF ALL SPACES AND ALL TIMES IN ALL UNIVERSES ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS.\n3 - Each universe has multiple (infinite) dimensions, spaces, and times. Let that sink in. This means that each universe has its own 'central' singularity, and ALL these central singularities, similar to black holes, are all connected to the GRAND CENTRAL SINGULARITY.\n4 - Hyperspace is a space between traditional spacetimes where relativity applies.\n5 - Hyperspace is quantum in nature that is unlimited exponentially, which is precisely why distance as measurement does not exist. It's stretched infinitely in all directions and is quantum in nature; as in, it moves between its space instantly.\n6 - If space is stretched infinitely, then so is time because time is dependent on space and space, on time.\n7 - All spatial existence we can understand intuitively from causality. For example, if you buy a table from Home Depot, it is in parts - but the passage of time allows those parts to be assembled into a table that you can then say is a full table. Time allows space to exist, and space exists because of time.\n8 - A spaceless existence is therefore a timeless existence because if there's no distance for causality to flow, then space cannot exist in traditional relativity; information can simply float between this space without the relativity of time being a factor.\n9 - The GCS is sitting in a hyperspace layer in between ALL-hyperspaces in a quantum-entangled-null-space connected to all proceeding hyperspaces and traditional spacetime dimensions (such as classical reality), which is transmitting information to and fro.\n10 - The GCS is quite literally the “end point” singularity we are all going to and the beginning we started from, as it is just as much the present that is transmitting data from the past and future into the present.\n11 - The 'present' is singularity itself; an aspect of the GCS in tangible form.\nAdditional:\n1 - The GCS is interconnected throughout all spaces, times, and dimensions and EVERYTHING - not just living beings - but rocks, water, gasses, suns, computers, action figures, clothes; inanimate, seemingly 'dead things' - are ALL connected to it and ALL bear a fraction of it.\n2 - The GCS is everything and anything, so in this sense, I suppose you can see where mystics, philosophers and spiritualists develop ideas of 'universal love.'\n3 - The GCS is both the distant future and past as much as it is the present. You have to get used to this thinking to really understand it. Everything and everyone from a linear-causal perspective will \"become it\" just as much as they always were it. From what my contacts revealed to me, somehow, the GCS is empowering itself into higher and higher stages of further \"reincarnations.\" That is why existence exists and continues \"paying it forward.\" For a practical example, picture if I were to give you $20,000 to invest in your business. I'd expect you to give a ROI of let's say 150%. GCS is doing this.\nGCS is like an infinitely entangled ball of infinite strings interconnected throughout all spaces and times. Imagine a black hole - moreso a supermassive black hole - of which, a galaxy orbits around and is affected by its gravity. GCS has its \"spiral arms\" extended throughout all spaces and all times. We are all \"co-creators\" and \"the creator\" in different times and spaces.",

            "Question": "Can you talk more about this in the soul field and how we can access it via our own consciousness growth? I sense humans have large potential but we don't know how to access it or develop it properly.",
            "Answer": "I've consistently mentioned meditation but I did not get into much detail yesterday because I wanted my contacts to verify if I should continue. I've been given the OK, so I will share more. Meditation is not just about the obvious physical benefits such as better blood pressure, stable heart rate and breathing, along with the relaxation it provides. It's also about the aptitude of the pineal gland or as mystics call it 'third eye.' I've had difficulty processing this because I come from a background related to astrophysics, so at first, these concepts seemed completely otherworldly to me, but alas, they are all true. Meditation allows one to access their 'true self' which is the 'God-part' or the 'GCS-individuum-force' (aka \"spirit\") that bears no 'personality' in the traditional sense. Through meditation, one can become more familiar with the GCS-self or \"spirit\" and draw upon its power in the physical realm. Consciousness is awareness, so the higher the awareness, the more information/data the spirit has to work with. I can continue if need be, let me know.",

            "Question": "Is there a differentiation between contact with nhi and what are sometimes known as spirit guides? Or put a different way- Is it obvious when you're connecting with an NHi?",
            "Answer": "For me, it is because I have already met them in person, seen their ships in person (up close) and remote viewed them. My telepathic abilities are at a level what you'd describe 'expert' (I spent 25 years developing it) and at this level, I can differentiate between who/what is contacting me. This is important because untrained telepathy can lead to contacting some not-so-good forces who can play upon your beliefs such as making you believe it is 'God' or some other force. It takes time, mental training, and supplying yourself with the necessary education. As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to your spirit, the less you can be deceived. Not only by NHI/higher forces, but by the matrix you live in and the humans trying to deceive you. Spirit guides, if you wish to call it that, are very rare. They mostly influence people unconsciously. These are beings who are beyond physical spacetime, which many NHI/ET, aren't. These beings are almost like the GCS \"protection squad.\" They keep things in order for the ultimate reintegration \"at the end of time.",

            "Question": "Would you mind expanding on frequencies? How does hz influence the outcome?",
            "Answer": "Light, sound, and energy are - at a certain point in time - one. Certain frequencies can stimulate the vibrations of the mind/consciousness. Some are harmful. Others can attune or be closer to the \"spirit\" energy. As a rule of thumb, if it is more attuned to the spirit, it is more attuned to the GCS. The more attuned you are to the GCS, the more you can draw upon its power in all directions of past, present, and future. I highly recommend 852, 285, 396, and 639. There are others, but that should be sufficient to start with.",
