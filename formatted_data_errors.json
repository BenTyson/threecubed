            "Question": "Very many answers you provide describe will/willpower as being the driving force of not only the GCS, but our individuated spirits. Is willpower something we can increase through conscious processes?",
            "Answer": "Yes. Willpower is directly tied to the realme/spirit and influences the interconnected soul field and singularities. Willpower isn’t increased by thoughts perse, but by DRIVE. This is why man can still learn from “lower life” such as animals who do not second guess themselves so much as commit instinctively. Sentience can sometimes trick itself to be even less powerful than those with lesser consciousness expansion spaces. Meditation is obviously a big key here because direct synchronization with the realme/spirit = downloads/pulls upon this force into the physicality and increasingly makes it as the predominant “personality” of the being with their avatar/lower vessel form. Another way to look at it is what Yoda said in Star Wars – “Do or do not. There is no try.” Commit. Even if you make mistakes, you can always learn/improve and come back better/stronger/wiser.",

            "Question": "",
            "Answer": "ET ships, especially with the not-drones incident, was one of the few times of mass sightings on such a global level (that’s still ongoing, by the way – just not being reported!). This year has had a MASSIVE UNSTOPPABLE SHIFT. Yes, some channelers may go overboard with the light and love to the extreme – but in truth, they are right. The “main battle” between good and evil has already been won. I cannot disclose too many details of this just yet because it’s too early. I will eventually, but what you should know is that me (and others) interconnected in this mission have been waging “psionic warfare” that, as of 2025, has been largely won for the good of mankind. A lot of positive shifts are happening. However, to make an omelet, I suppose you have to crack some eggs. A lot of the bad forces, especially the elite rulership, won’t like what has happened and what is coming. They’ll try double-time to push war, chaos, division, negativity, pessimism and the like in your face – especially with the news and alternative media. This is all part of their plan to keep humanity locked in a bubble of negativity. Look beyond it. The good is winning. More and more people are waking up every day. 2025 is the first year in centuries that I can tell you the earth, despite some necessary upcoming turmoil, will be fine and will make it.",

            "Question": "",
            "Answer": "I’ve never probed much into this question, but I can confirm that there are different types of greys based on the station/lab they were created from and purpose. They have pupils/irises, it’s just covered another layer/coat. Yes, they can see a much broader spectrum of not just light but other planes/dimensions, including what we incorrectly call “spiritual.” There’s much more to it, but I have not personally asked them yet. Should I?",
