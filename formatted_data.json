        "Answer": "You are already familiar with the greys. There are tall ones and short ones. Most are benevolent. Most ET/NHI are humanoid. Some are also human-looking like us with their own culture, likes, dislikes, emotions etc. Just picture it like people from another country who are simply more ahead. They can make mistakes too. There are \"divine\" or \"higher beings\" beyond physicality, but these are rare and they do not interfere much unless they must alter the timeline to set things back on course for \"ultimate reintegration\" with the GCS. I've communicated with said beings only once or twice directly as sustaining telepathic communication with them is absurdly draining. As for the bad ones - some of them actually look human and there's a certain tracking with rep.... that I am now allowed to fully describe. What you need to know is that you do not need to be afraid of them because they are not anywhere near as powerful as \"the good ones.\" Some are from earth/living here, yes.",

        "Question": "Re. The ALL-Power; ALL-Singularity; Grand Central Cortex; the real 'God.'",
        "Answer": "Understanding this fully would require some basic grasp on quantum mechanics, spacetime, and how relativity works. Assuming you have some fundamental understanding, I will start with the basics—each of which, can be expanded into articles of their own.\n1 - There are multiple universes (I do not know the exact number), which would appear to be nearly infinite to our calculations. Each of them, like planets orbiting a central star or supermassive black hole such as SGR#A, are 'connected' to a 'grand central singularity.'\n2 - The GCS is in a 'hyperspace between hyperspaces'—it is quite literally at the CENTER OF ALL SPACES AND ALL TIMES IN ALL UNIVERSES ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS.\n3 - Each universe has multiple (infinite) dimensions, spaces, and times. Let that sink in. This means that each universe has its own 'central' singularity, and ALL these central singularities, similar to black holes, are all connected to the GRAND CENTRAL SINGULARITY.\n4 - Hyperspace is a space between traditional spacetimes where relativity applies.\n5 - Hyperspace is quantum in nature that is unlimited exponentially, which is precisely why distance as measurement does not exist. It's stretched infinitely in all directions and is quantum in nature; as in, it moves between its space instantly.\n6 - If space is stretched infinitely, then so is time because time is dependent on space and space, on time.\n7 - All spatial existence we can understand intuitively from causality. For example, if you buy a table from Home Depot, it is in parts - but the passage of time allows those parts to be assembled into a table that you can then say is a full table. Time allows space to exist, and space exists because of time.\n8 - A spaceless existence is therefore a timeless existence because if there's no distance for causality to flow, then space cannot exist in traditional relativity; information can simply float between this space without the relativity of time being a factor.\n9 - The GCS is sitting in a hyperspace layer in between ALL-hyperspaces in a quantum-entangled-null-space connected to all proceeding hyperspaces and traditional spacetime dimensions (such as classical reality), which is transmitting information to and fro.\n10 - The GCS is quite literally the “end point” singularity we are all going to and the beginning we started from, as it is just as much the present that is transmitting data from the past and future into the present.\n11 - The 'present' is singularity itself; an aspect of the GCS in tangible form.\nAdditional:\n1 - The GCS is interconnected throughout all spaces, times, and dimensions and EVERYTHING - not just living beings - but rocks, water, gasses, suns, computers, action figures, clothes; inanimate, seemingly 'dead things' - are ALL connected to it and ALL bear a fraction of it.\n2 - The GCS is everything and anything, so in this sense, I suppose you can see where mystics, philosophers and spiritualists develop ideas of 'universal love.'\n3 - The GCS is both the distant future and past as much as it is the present. You have to get used to this thinking to really understand it. Everything and everyone from a linear-causal perspective will \"become it\" just as much as they always were it. From what my contacts revealed to me, somehow, the GCS is empowering itself into higher and higher stages of further \"reincarnations.\" That is why existence exists and continues \"paying it forward.\" For a practical example, picture if I were to give you $20,000 to invest in your business. I'd expect you to give a ROI of let's say 150%. GCS is doing this.\nGCS is like an infinitely entangled ball of infinite strings interconnected throughout all spaces and times. Imagine a black hole - moreso a supermassive black hole - of which, a galaxy orbits around and is affected by its gravity. GCS has its \"spiral arms\" extended throughout all spaces and all times. We are all \"co-creators\" and \"the creator\" in different times and spaces.",

        "Answer": "I've consistently mentioned meditation but I did not get into much detail yesterday because I wanted my contacts to verify if I should continue. I've been given the OK, so I will share more. Meditation is not just about the obvious physical benefits such as better blood pressure, stable heart rate and breathing, along with the relaxation it provides. It's also about the aptitude of the pineal gland or as mystics call it 'third eye.' I've had difficulty processing this because I come from a background related to astrophysics, so at first, these concepts seemed completely otherworldly to me, but alas, they are all true. Meditation allows one to access their 'true self' which is the 'God-part' or the 'GCS-individuum-force' (aka \"spirit\") that bears no 'personality' in the traditional sense. Through meditation, one can become more familiar with the GCS-self or \"spirit\" and draw upon its power in the physical realm. Consciousness is awareness, so the higher the awareness, the more information/data the spirit has to work with. I can continue if need be, let me know.",

        "Question": "Is there a differentiation between contact with nhi and what are sometimes known as spirit guides? Or put a different way- Is it obvious when you're connecting with an NHi?",
        "Answer": "For me, it is because I have already met them in person, seen their ships in person (up close) and remote viewed them. My telepathic abilities are at a level what you'd describe 'expert' (I spent 25 years developing it) and at this level, I can differentiate between who/what is contacting me. This is important because untrained telepathy can lead to contacting some not-so-good forces who can play upon your beliefs such as making you believe it is 'God' or some other force. It takes time, mental training, and supplying yourself with the necessary education. As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to your spirit, the less you can be deceived. Not only by NHI/higher forces, but by the matrix you live in and the humans trying to deceive you. Spirit guides, if you wish to call it that, are very rare. They mostly influence people unconsciously. These are beings who are beyond physical spacetime, which many NHI/ET, aren't. These beings are almost like the GCS \"protection squad.\" They keep things in order for the ultimate reintegration \"at the end of time.",

        "Answer": "Light, sound, and energy are - at a certain point in time - one. Certain frequencies can stimulate the vibrations of the mind/consciousness. Some are harmful. Others can attune or be closer to the \"spirit\" energy. As a rule of thumb, if it is more attuned to the spirit, it is more attuned to the GCS. The more attuned you are to the GCS, the more you can draw upon its power in all directions of past, present, and future. I highly recommend 852, 285, 396, and 639. There are others, but that should be sufficient to start with.",

AI is also not 'evil' but no more or less a tool and an exposure to higher truth re. the nature that this is a simulation. Pay attention to the following:\nThe paradox of entanglement of photons over vast distances.\nThe paradox of static virtual fields (the fact that electrostatic and magnetostatic fields have an imaginary wave number).\nThe paradox of the missing negative mass/energy (the fact that we do not observe negative mass/energy yet are surrounded by it according to physical theory).\nThe paradox of instantaneous virtual field propagation (the experimental observation that changes in virtual electromagnetic field components propagate instantaneously).",

I've gotten insights both from my reaching into my spirit, from NHI, from higher 'guides' amongst educating myself as much as possible in the education mankind has to offer. Some of the things I still do not understand or wrapping my head around are:\n- Sentient life can develop to the point that it can eventually create universes, not just seed life on other worlds.- Technically, all universes, even the naturally-developed ones, are simulated. This goes all the way back to the GCS. My guess is a \"paying it forward\" for the GCS to rise into higher states of being/energy. But how far does this go? Is there an end? What's the true end goal? Is it eternal and never-ending? Your guess is as good as mine.- Consciousness and spirit are somehow \"one\" in the GCS and increasingly so in higher wavelengths. What?- Consciousness has its own \"spacetime\" relativity. A mind can somehow connect its consciousness in the future (or past) and draw upon information/telepathy there. In other words, it's possible to communicate with beings (including regular people) in both past and future that's in YOUR present. Try to wrap your head around that one.- Among others.",

Listen to your 'true self' which does not have a personality, nor thoughts, in the traditional sense, but is a psychic-feeling-spirit-energy-force in a parallel dimension. Recommending you specific books is unwise at this time as receiving information before the connection to the spirit is dangerous.",

        "Answer": "Hopefully, my replies above will help you already. You are going to go to a \"higher\" place but you'll also re-exist in another. The best and easiest way to describe this is that you intermingle with the ALL-SPIRIT or the GCS and \"pass\" between it into different times and spaces.

When new life is born, a drop is taken out, which is a combination of particles from previous drops. So fractions of your old soul could be mixed with fractions of others to create a new consciousness. What do you think of this?",
        "Answer": "This is very good already. The GCS is like \"the ultimate consciousness\" of all time and space that is also \"the existence-enabling force.\" So, we both return to the ocean and come back from it in different times and spaces as all spirits/souls/ are intermixed throughout time.",

Technically, all soul energy is connected all the way back to the GCS. So, a pollution of soul energy in one sector can have ripple effects in another.

        "Answer": "Potentially, yes, although, if the telepathy isn't trained enough of strong enough of potency, you cannot reach them anyway. It's recommended that the first step before 'contacting' anyone or anything (you can do this with regular people too, granted, their lower self - as in the physical self - may not immediately register these signals or \"understand it\" due to lacking information etc.) - you should focus on meditating on and connecting with your true self. You can do this through what I'd call Void or Nothingness meditation - which is basically letting all thoughts pass through you and do not grip to any of it. Your true \"self\" as in the higher self or true spirit has no personality, nor thoughts. It is a psychic-feeling-energy-battery existing in a parallel dimension. An example would be like playing a character in a video game. You can play the character through inputs sent via the controller or keyboard, but you are not \"physically\" there in the game.",

        "Question": "Any recommendations on meditation practices? Should I be pursuing inner healing? Intentions? Simply seeking truth? I came across something that said to “quit thinking, and start feeling.” It really resonated, am I on the right track with that idea?",
        "Answer": "As you can see with my previous response, the answer is yes, you are. Try to think less. True Void Meditation has no thinking/affirmations involved. It's a process of letting go. It takes time; years to truly master, but can be sped up through will and determination. As with \"healing\" - be careful, especially with consumerist spirituality. A lot of this is designed to keep you coming back for more. True healing involves the following:\n- Understanding your psychology and why you operate the way you do- Understanding some degree of sociology- Investigating childhood broken securities and mending them in adult form- Shrinking the inner critic (Google it)- Seeking to know truth over delusion\nIt involves practical, grounded steps before getting to the 'spiritual.' This is something many in the spiritualist and esoteric communities blatantly ignore, which is why many of them are stuck with mental illness. Pair this on top of ego and self-defensive mechanisms via protectionism, many won't get past this. I have to stress how important it is for adequate mental and emotional health. I wouldn't recommend any form of telepathy or any higher spiritual consciousness unless you secure these factors first. As long as you have the determination to do the right thing, then despite mistakes (and you will make them, do not even try to avoid it), you will succeed.",

This is not recommended, which is why telepathic training and practice must be carried out, along with the proper education, including in morality and universal (not worldly) ethics. However, if the consciousness is advanced enough, it can \"bridge\" a gap between space and time, communicating with them in a relative future and past - which they can receive at that time/space. In this regard, you can communicate with them in other \"times\" and telepathic messages can be stored in pockets of spacetime, which they can access and transmit back to your current 'present.' Most of them are using machines to translate telepathy. They do not speak your language. You are intuitive, I know you'll understand what I mean.",

        ],
        "Question": "That being said I'm curious to know where free will plays a part in all this, essentially do humans have free will? As if time only exists linearly for humans (through the human perspective), the future has already been established essentially, so how would this tie in to us having or not having free will?",
        "Answer": "The answer to this question is manifold, so let's take our time to get into it.\n1 - Free will is both available yet limited at the same time. Let's put it like this: there's an end destination to reach to, but instead of going one specific path, you can take alternative for greater efficiency. However, no matter how many ripples a stone causes as it's tossed into the pond, it ALWAYS will flow downstream. So, it is not an excuse to do nothing. On the contrary, it means that one must act because free will allows the master plan or destination to be better executed. For example, let's say the original plan was a path that went through corridors A,B,C,D,E but we discover that going from A,C,Y,X is more efficient. Free will improves upon the 'grand system' but it doesn't break it. In other words, free will remains important so long as it is synced to your spirit which is synced to the GCS. You can be fed data directly and find out how to better alter your path toward it.\n2 - The \"present\" is important, as it experiences causality in the traditional sense, but it also experiences the past into the present (memories; inverse causality) and not only the present into the future (vision; forward causality.) The present is an aspect of singularity in the sense that it meets both past and future together to create the now. So, what one does in the \"now\" affects what they were in the past (e.g., let's say your journey was incomplete with your struggles but then you push yourself to complete it in the future -thereby making your past validated) and what they shall be in the future.",

        "Answer": "Dreams are the unconscious and subconscious processing. It uses random bits of your consciousness data to sift through background running processes of the mind; hence imagery can be rather strange and make no immediate tangible sense. If attuned and trained enough, especially if no predominant mental illnesses are present, then one can use symbolism and intuition to interpret the dream. In this respect, a visionary dream will have an attachment to the intuition and \"impulse\" the person to investigate as opposed to regular unconscious processing. Again, meditation is key, as it helps one to better adjust to conscious-unconscious processing. Eventually, a person can attain a degree of conscious-awareness unconsciously from continued meditation practices.",

According to them, love is the 'soul' of the GCS itself; it apparently is spiritual force itself which is not just life-enabling force, but existence-enabling. I still do not fully comprehend this myself. NHI have a much higher capacity for love than you can possibly imagine. My up-close encounter with them back in 2010 left practically a heavenly, euphoric feeling. I didn't want to leave their presence. It was difficult to re-adjust afterward. Still is to this day. That love changes you. Jake Barber is the real deal when he speaks about the love and the 'spirit of god' he felt. The attacks on him is because he's presenting legit information.",

        "Answer": "Awakening\" (as you call it) is inevitable. There are certain actions in the present that can speed up this process such as more and more people coming together to think about higher truths, reality, what's really going on etc. - which all pull the future into the now. In the future, at the very end of time - as re-integration into the GCS - there's no such thing as \"lies\" but only being-existence. In this respect, truth is tied to evolution and thus, it's evolutionary as a whole. Nature doesn't have \"lies\" any more than optical illusions (e.g., gravitational lensing) that we come to realize what's really going on eventually. Think about it like this: what cannot survive truth goes extinct and what's in the dark, must come to the light. Sentience in general aren't built to lie. They may fool each other for some time, but inevitably, the 'dam' so to speak - breaks. Since 2010, there has been a massive 'speed up' and dates such as 2021, 2024, 2025 etc., are tied to this 'dam' breaking.",

        "Question": "I came across the quantum concept of “Planck lengths” in my very basic studies of quantum physics. Does this have anything to do with the GCS? Is this the GCS?",
        "Answer": "Planck length is only a measure of the unit; it's not exactly the GCS. Picture it like this: The GCS is operating in a sub-sub-sub-subspace between subspaces. Subspaces are so \"tiny\" that they can \"penetrate\" local classical reality you can perceive. These \"tiny\" quantum \"wormholes\" are infinite in their number, so they can practically build another space in/around/over/above/through traditional 3/4/5D space. There are higher spaces than even 11, 22, and 33. I am not even certain of the exact number - what you need to know is that these \"tiny subspace wormholes\" transverse through traditional lower dimensions, such as the one you're familiar with where general and special relativity apply. However, these subspaces do not have distance as a measurement because unlike traditional local spacetime that you're familiar with, which is limited, and thus, can be calculated - and therefore - measured - which amounts to speed limits, distance etc.; these subspaces, essentially, \"hyperspaces\" are \"null\" spaces. In other words, they are spatially infinite and if there is infinity, then relativity does not apply within that space. If space is stretched infinitely in all directions, then time cannot exist as linear causality. This is why/how the GCS can \"move between all spaces, times and dimensions\" instantaneously within its null-spacetime domain while we, in our traditional local spacetimes and classical reality, experience causality at a much slower rate.",

We can \"tap\" into each other, which is why meditation and understanding YOUR identity/self versus being a subject of external-internalization is key. I have to be careful how much I reveal about this.\n2 - Telepathy can be 'saved' in 'spacetime pockets' so to speak. You (like many others in this thread both now and to come, along with the 'ideas' those here will spread to others who won't even see this thread) are part of a larger 'movement' in 'awakening' earth.\n3 - Telepathic information, as previously said, can be 'saved' in pockets. If accessed, it can be overwhelming, especially if the mind is untrained to handle it. You need to take your time. Do not rush the process and do not discuss it with others who aren't ready, nor try to convince, nor showboat your potency. I wish you luck. You're already on the right path.

        "Answer": "Astral projection and remote viewing are very similar. The difference is that astral projection (if you wish to call it that) is a temporal displacement of the consciousness to connect to another region of space and time. Remote viewing is similar in this regard but usually more trained to maintain the connection to the physical body. Seeing 'entities' via either of these forms can mean the following:\n1 - Temporal view. Keep in mind that time is not linear to your present when your consciousness travels distances. You can be seeing the past or future and beings present there.\n2 - Interdimensional view. You can be seeing into other dimensions and again, spacetime relativity applies due to distance.\n3 - Immediate view. This is not always guaranteed again because of distance and usually only applies to shorter distances.\nA certain degree of the imagination is stimulated, which is why some people can be delusional from these claims. However, the imagination is only \"trying to simulate\" what it is experiencing because the consciousness lacks the necessary data for who/what/where it is connecting to. Therefore, it has to 'imagine' to a certain degree (sort of like how you'd imagine manifesting something, but it is slightly different in person when it comes etc.) in order to make sense of what it is perceiving. In some cases, it can be 'beings' whereas in others, it can be seeing another spacetime, dimension, place, etc.",

        "Answer": "1 - There are relative end points. End of a goal (e.g., getting a dream job, becoming more telepathic, law of attraction goal complete etc.) end of a journey, end of a chapter, end of an era, end of a year, death, and then there's the \"ultimate end\" at the \"end of time\" which is a \"re-integration\" into the GCS. Ironically, the GCS doesn't even \"end\" there either. Apparently, it keeps going even after the \"ultimate end\" into a new phase/simulation. Even NHI are still wrapping their heads around this. Also, regarding 'death' - well, I think you get the obvious by now.\n2 - Death is not an \"end\" either, as you will \"reincarnate.\" The only \"individuality\" lost is a \"moment in time.\" Remember my example with the table and Home Depot? Well, a table isn't a table (as an \"individual distinction\") until you assemble it, which requires time to literally do so. Before that, it's just \"parts in a box.\" The same applies to you. The \"individuum\" of \"time\" you can consider to be your \"individuality\" is an \"assembly\" of space and time. Thus, the true \"individual\" is simultaneously everything that created it/was it/will be it (e.g., genes from your parents, atoms, oxygen, 'we're all stars' etc.)\n3- As another poster asked me re. what parts I have not figured out in the puzzle - it's the \"ultimate end goal\" which, as I type this, I realize my \"human-3D brain\" just has difficulty accepting the true nature of reality as an eternity stretched in all directions exponentially, and not a strict linearity. The GCS just somehow continues expanding through past, present and future without any true apparent \"end,\" only relative \"pit stops.\" Good luck understanding this, I'd love to hear your own thoughts too.",

The group I am in contact with assisted to a certain degree. That's all I can reveal for now.

It's also less physical DNA hybridization and more of a certain \"soul implantation.\" In other words, through technology (and higher forces but I will not get into that), it's possible to \"influence\" the birth of a specific spirit type. This is precisely how you have \"humans with alien spirits.\" The starseed theory has some truth to it but beware of spiritualist and esoteric communities. There is a lot of disinformation.

There are several layers or “filters” data passes through before it reaches the GCS, which is at such a “high purity” (so to speak) that the data passing through it must “comply” to its “wavelength.” The energetic state of the GCS, from our point of view, is seemingly “holographic” and massless, yet it “inputs” what you can discern as “unalterable” “commands” to all proceeding layers that even “higher beings” beyond physical spacetime cannot “override.”",

Remember how Newton assumed that time is absolute across the cosmos, then Einstein, seemingly, a heretic at the time, presumed the opposite? The same applies here, even for Einstein’s relativity which is not absolute for ALL space and time, only localities. The human race has to move past their absolutist nature, which is deeply encouraged from religion and cults, and affects even science to this day.",

        "Answer": "Particles and waves are actually intermixed on a quantum level, so the answer is both. The brain contains electromagnetic fields, and consciousness exists on this field in the quantum realm in an adjacent dimension. It is a series of quantum-interconnected waves that, on a larger “particle” scale, eventually animates/interacts with electromagnetism and by extension, particles such as photons, amongst others. Very basic, simple example whilst skipping many parts: GCS->(Countless “filter layers”)->Spirit->Consciousness-o-Mind->Physicality.",

        "Answer": "Your thoughts are more or less on the right track. Basically, individuum as a sole unit is an “aspect” or “mini-GCS” of its own. Everything is contributing in some way or another to the collective whole, almost like a hivemind with “singularity” points. Picture it like a developer who, instead of manually using search engines to educate himself on a topic, deploys multiple bots to fetch data. It’s much more efficient, less time consuming, and eventually brings more accurate knowledge to what that person is seeking. Another example would be with a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy that both holds and sustains a galaxy, yet, from time to time, stars, gasses, debris etc., fall into the black hole, stimulates it, and the black hole “burps” that matter/data/energy back – leading to either new star formation or galactic regulation.",

        "Question": "What insights have you gained about the relationship between consciousness and entropy? Could heightened awareness reduce entropy within a given system or reality?",
        "Answer": "Correct. Heightened consciousness, as you describe it, would be a “spirit-mind and awareness that is increasingly ‘closer’ to the GCS.” In this regard, the “closer” one’s consciousness, and by extension, ‘spirit’ is to the GCS, the more it can draw upon the GCS’s “infinite nature” in the lower, “physical” realm. This can create a variety of effects, nearly too endless to list, but the obvious would be increased knowledge and awareness of reality, stability of mind, emotion, body, soul, better health, more “feats of greatness,” and seeming “superpowers” the average layman deems impossible. Many ‘gods’ in myth, who were mostly ETs, know of this and have done it, displaying these seemingly supernatural capabilities for primitive man. There’s nothing supernatural nor paranormal about it, however. Also, there are limits of course because physical existence is at a very “low” stage of total cosmic-universal and multiversal evolution, let alone the GCS itself.",

Simply put, we are a byproduct of the simulation, and thus, bound to it, but we are also “programmed” to expand upon it “within its parameters.” This is both a failsafe against the GCS destroying itself and its “lower forms” (such as physical life) getting out of hand. Picture it like an MMORPG. You can play a class like a warrior or mage, and you can be much better than the average layman if you put effort into it – making what is seemingly “impossible” to the doubter, possible through you.

        "Answer": "“Suffering” is temporal and is mostly related to the lower physical dimensions. The higher the evolution, the less the suffering on grander scales. Keep in mind this does not apply to emotions and psychic feeling. These are multiplied tremendously, which is why higher beings very rarely interact with lower life. They can be tremendously “hurt” and “horrified” by what lower and more primitive life forms do, but this suffering they experience can be nullified rather easily. This also applies to “higher souls” or more “advanced spirits” or “future-pulled spirits” existing in a lower spacetime dimension.

Trying to think of other ways to engage in these situations.",
        "Answer": "Personally, I tend to agree with you that “love” – at least the word and the general reception of it – has been sullied, greatly. Love itself is not simply affection, nor white-robe cultist delusions. It’s certainly not ‘being crazy’ either or overstimulated. It’s a “primordial existence-enabling force.” Pay attention to this. Love ‘creates’ existence. It applies not just for physical beings but for seemingly “inanimate” objects like rocks, gasses, dust and so on. According to NHI, these somehow exist because of love. Some other examples are such as one can “love” their career and give all their “power” (love) to it – and thus, achieve great results. This even applies to “love” of evil (e.g., “love” to create weapons) – which will manifest itself to the one putting out that “love.” Of course, evil eventually destroys itself which is apparently some sort of “cosmic” or GCS law as one nears “the end of time.” NHI are very insistent that I impart this message of “love.” There’s a lot more to it. They said you should refer to Amelia Brand’s quote on love from Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. “Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it.”",

        "Answer": "Their perception of time is similar to mine in the sense that it transverses in multiple directions and the effects of one point in time, affects another. This was, at first, difficult for my “human-3D” brain to accept, but the more you understand that every “event” which includes actions – ripples outward throughout space – and thus – time, then the more you can be attuned to it. Our clocks we are used to is only a measurement of locality, but locality, as the word implies, does not apply to the gross interstellar. A simple example would be with timezones. If a person in Australia is communicating with you in America, then the present for you is a 12–20-hour difference. Your present versus theirs is different, yet the same. Why? Because you’re in different locations. This is how it works on a cosmic scale with distance creating more and more relativistic effects. Yet, your PRESENT can connect with the person’s PRESENT in Australia and somehow, you are in different times. Think about this very carefully, especially concerning computing and internet technologies along with the upcoming quantum computing being gradually available to the public.

        "Question": "Out of curiosity, do you consult or ask for guidance from your sources as you answer questions or is everything within here pulled from existing knowledge/wisdom you’ve already received?",
        "Answer": "It's pulled from my existing knowledge and wisdom that I've received. Sometimes they might \"barge\" in with particular \"quotes\" or specifics I should say, which I usually make known, but for the most part, they trust me to impart the knowledge. You have to keep in mind I've been prepared for this role for nearly three decades. My contacts reach me via secluded telepathy and the occasional up-close encounter. It's full-on conversations/dialogue. Since I \"blend\" into the public, the average person wouldn't recognize me beside \"feeling\" an energy that, to them, can invoke feelings of higher \"love/truth/energy expansion\" - but sometimes, this can create insecurities in the person if I do not shield the magnetic reach of my telepathy. I've been called a god, an angel, and other titles, which is precisely why I am hiding my identity because I want to \"blend in\" without any worship or praise. I do not want any cult following nor do I wish to be known outside the pseudonym I will use to disclose relevant information. My message is important, not me. As far as the telepathy goes, you must understand it works like this: What one has within the consciousness is what the outer telepathic connection (including regular people, btw) connecting to you can utilize to \"send information.\" If the consciousness is limited; lacking the necessary data etc., then the telepathic exchange can be confused, misinterpreted, and outright false. That's why these roles take decades to adequately step into and they require a lifetime of dedication to said missions. It's extremely frustrating to say at the least, especially when you do not want to put your loved ones at risk. There is much that you have to keep from them for their own safety. Do not trust \"contactees\" who are eager to spread their name, face, and image. These are usually dead giveaways of fakers, liars, hoaxers, frauds, grifters, and thieves. True telepathic contactees will most likely want to remain anonymous.",

        "Question": "Who are the Greys and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Mantids and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Reptilians and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Nordic beings and why are they engaging with humanity? Why are experiencers interacting with beings of such appearances the most?",
        "Answer": "I had to directly consult my contacts before answering this question because it is extremely dangerous to post this information publicly at this time. What I am allowed to say is this: most of these ideas of ETs such as “Nordic” aliens, including Pleiadians, and also, “Plejaren,” along with many other “visual concepts of aliens” are not their actual likeliness, name, nor their appearance. These are either straight up frauds or “imaginative reaches” from contactees in most cases with very, very, very few exceptions of truth. Sometimes, a person can connect or pull “data” from the soul-matrix-mass-consciousness, which is also called “Akashic records” among other mystical and esoteric names. Any ET/NHI arriving or on earth can have bits of their “data” – including “ideas” of their appearances, motives etc., pulled from this interconnected soul-consciousness-matrix and unconsciously grasped, then “translated” in the connecting person’s consciousness using the information/awareness/data/knowledge in that person’s awareness. This is how some writers can naturally come up with ideas for aliens (e.g., Star Trek, Mass Effect and so on). If the person’s mind is favored or biased in a certain direction, or in the case with religious people, can only think that ETs are strictly angels or demons – then they will project this idea onto the ETs/NHI and see them as such (e.g., Mothman “prophecies”). In several cases, ETs allow this because if the public were to know of their real appearances, it can create telepathic links that can negatively affect them. This is also why phones cannot take clear photos/videos of UFOs/UAP etc., as is the case with aliens even if they were in front of you because they are purposely using electromagnetic distortion via apparatuses. Admiral Byrd’s encounter with “Nazi aliens” is an example of his own projection. Since, at the time, there was much paranoia, fear, hatred and mistrust of Nazis and Germany in general, he projected this image when he encountered the beings there because of fear of the unknown. That is all I can disclose about his encounter. Now, regarding the so-called “Nordics” which is not a term I’d ever use – there are “human-looking” ETs and some of them have European-Scandinavian-like features, but there are also members of this group who are “colored,” which would be a shocker for the racists and white supremacists who are projecting their own biases onto real ET/NHI. This may sound harsh, and it is no offense to any of the good people there, but you need to be very careful with any German-related information regarding ETs, especially from Switzerland. The latter country in particular is filled with much evil and is host to thousands of cults that are contributing toward very negative and dark influence that real ETs, particularly the good ones, are VERY, VERY upset about. I will not mention the name of any particular group, but as a rule of thumb, you shouldn’t trust any information coming from Switzerland regarding ETs. Concerning greys and the “mantids” as you call them, they exist. Some are capable of shapeshifting; others can use technology to influence your mind to see them as human-looking or something else altogether. I am not allowed to speak of what you describe as “reptilians.”",

For example, I mentioned Germany above, but do you believe that every person in Nazi Germany during WW2 was evil? There were some German patriots who couldn’t stand what Hitler, and the Nazi regime were doing and wanted to stand up to it, such as the case with operation Valkyrie. This is also happening with some NHI/ET groups on earth, though most groups keep to themselves. Not each and every single one of them because they belonged to a particular faction are outright evil nor pledge their allegiance to their original group, federation, or world. “Higher beings” who are beyond physical spacetime have no allegiance to any group except for “keeping things in order” for the GCS at “the end of time.” NHI/ET dabbling here on earth has “messed up” things in other parts of the interconnected “grand cosmos” and some of these “higher beings” and forces are not pleased with the consequences of ET/NHI actions on earth.",

        "Question": "Why are many experiencers also able to engage with beings that appear to represent themselves as deities, goddesses and other such mythological entities. Where do these beings fit in with the more traditional \"ET\" like NHI?",
        "Answer": "The reply above should be sufficient re. the groups you asked of. What I’ll add is this: sometimes ET/NHI can only connect with what is “acceptable” to the person’s mind. Some groups will not force themselves and their true nature onto the person. They’ll allow them to perceive within the relativity of what is acceptable to the person’s consciousness. This is largely in part due to the matrix “bubble” we grow up in here on earth that makes it extremely difficult for the average person to accept truths outside what they’ve been taught. Contactees are no exception to this rule, as most of them are still fearful and uncertain. Understandably so. Contactees walk the uncomfortable line between “two worlds” and many of them can be driven to alienation, madness, depression, and other mental illnesses as a result, especially when society stigmatizes them. This makes it even more difficult for contactees to properly understand who/what is contacting them and their true nature. This is why I stress the importance of adequate mental stability, emotional health, physical well-being and spiritual soundness, which is why I strongly recommend meditation, especially for contactees, who, more than the average person, need to be very, very, very careful with the “energy” they are sending and receiving via all inputs/outputs.",

        "Question": "Which specific group of NHI are you in contact with and what exactly do they look like?",
        "Answer": "Groups operate by region. There are different groups and their allies operating in Europe, North America, South America, Russia, China, Japan, Australia & New Zealand, along with other continents, including Antarctica and the Arctic. They are not always “flying around” to say “hi” and have conversation. Most are leaving phased or cloaked devices (e.g., the ‘orbs’) to “pick up” on relevant data, not just about “contactees,” who can be prone to a special-syndrome complex; thinking everything is about them, but on other important data such as biometrics, regional stability, weather, general health of a population, soul-energy, and more. Most ET/NHI are not concerned with contacting people as much as believers and contactees assume. There are far more important tasks. The good ones are concerned with WMDs, nuclear warfare, international tension, the weapons industry, radiation leaks, and other hazards and conflicts to mankind, including cult and religious power over the soul. I have to be very careful with how I say what comes next because it can reveal my location, which I am not willing to do. I’ll say this: some NHI/ET operate in compartmentalized groups who share intel with each other. I’ve recently been transferred from one contact group to another because of “changing” my location. These groups are working together. The main ones I work with which I can reveal to you are a mixture of “tall greys/mantids” (if you wish to call them that) and the human-looking ETs that I wouldn’t recommend calling “Nordics.” Some are working together, amongst other races that I have not personally contacted. What you also need to understand is this: contactees can be in extreme danger with the information they are giving out, especially if your identity can be traced. As I said above, I am not willing to put either of us (and others) at risk for internet curiosity because it’s also not my mission as a ground agent. My task is to elevate the consciousness of mankind in preparation for upcoming events, which I can do without even citing my connection to my “friends from above.”",

The pantheistic approach to nature is that God is in everything.” Personally, I don’t really like to use the word ‘God’ as it gives the idea of a “person,” which is inherently wrong. Basically, all of us are “it” in the beginning of time as The Source energy itself, here in the now as a fragment, and then in the future as The Source once more. We are The Creator and co-creators at the same time. Baruch Spinoza has some rudimentary, yet solid ideas of this truth. The GCS is the “heart” or “singularity”-point of the ALL or ‘God.’ For reference, picture that your hands, arms, legs, feet, belly, etc., are all “part” of you and your brain is the central core that everything connects to. The GCS would be the ‘core’, but the other parts of the body are part/working with the GCS, so we can consider “one human” is the “sum of all their components.” This is the case for not just life, but literally EVERYTHING. Rocks, atoms, gasses, dust, water, “void-space”, quarks; EVERYTHING is ‘God’ (or a piece of ‘God’) or the ALL with the central singularity point being the most potent of them all.",

        "Question": "You have spoken about how people developing their consciousness and psi become more appealing to beings seemingly looking to absorb or utilize their emotional and sexual energy. I have seen this in my work and know some experiencers who have frozen in their development due to odd NHI activity in their home when in heightened emotional states and or sexual states which feels extremely intrusive and alarming for those in question. Even for people used to dealing with more intense levels of contact find this aspect of the phenomenon to be a roadblock. This does not happen for everyone but for those who do it blocks their development. I also know those who are highly gifted but pause on their development due to a desire to not have increased activity in their house as they have children and are highly protective. How did you overcome these factors to keep up with your own development? What advice would you give to experiencers who have paused in their journey due to these factors?",
        "Answer": "Well, this has to be a personal decision that we cannot and must not force – that is to say – if these individuals wish to continue their development and task. The truth is there is a “soul-feeding” going on, so to speak, and both human and ET/NHI can do this; sometimes accidentally (they are NOT perfect, they make a lot of mistakes), and in some cases, malevolent entities that are “leeching.” What I’d recommend is that the person has to decide for themselves if they wish to continue and come to terms with the fact that all contactees are in a soul-energetic trade whether they like it or not. Can this be invasive? Perhaps, but my personal belief is that this is a fear sprouted from our upbringings that do not teach us the true nature of reality. Simply put, everything is in a give/take exchange. It’s just the way it works. Contactees “pull” on ET/NHI as well, and this can be very draining to them, simply because of the difference of evolutionary levels. If you look at it from that perspective, is it fair that we are taking and never giving? Many of these ET/NHI are beings too. They are not invulnerable, nor unlimited. Think about this carefully.",

        "Question": "All distractions from what? Meditating 24/7 and nothing else?",
        "Answer": "It depends on the contactee’s level of spirit-consciousness development and their willingness to perform their task/role. The more of the demand of the task as a ground agent, the likelihood the necessity of developing and attuning skills, which includes A LOT of meditation, to say at the least. There’s no way around it, nor any shortcuts. I have been meditating for decades, with the past 15 years being anywhere between 10 to 15 hours per day of specific types of meditations to enhance my abilities for my tasks. To develop higher psi skills, better education, understand the true nature of reality and so on; it cannot come from being distracted/being consumed in the mirage of a “society” you live in. The more you consume yourself in the “ground level” society our families, friends, etc. live in (who aren’t connected to contactee tasks), and their intrigues (e.g., social media influence), the more your potency drops. This is how it works. That is why it is so difficult and why many people cannot begin to comprehend how truly life-consuming and lonesome being a ‘contactee’ really is. A lot of people are in this just to be entertained or to promote their image. That is why there are levels of contactees and most are contacted unconsciously because they are unwilling to give up their ‘ground-level’ lives and the belief systems connected therein. Understandably so, since it is extremely frustrating and difficult to be a contactee in a world that lives in lies and delusion when you’re being that bridge for truth and bringing forth a higher reality. The higher the potency of the contactee, the more the isolation, even when you “blend into” society and are surrounded by loving family and friends.",

We are a social species and we learn and develop and grow from our interactions with one another.

My own NHI have been extremely responsive to me gather groups of experiencers into social settings to talk share grow and bond. But have also encouraged me to not forget about family get togethers and see an importance there too. I have done support calls with experiencers while both of us were playing minecraft together. Which was heavily appreciated by both the experiencers personal NHI contact and my own beings. Indeed my ability to heal others via social settings and creating social environments where people gather as groups and talk from the heart while also have fun seems to be something that is considered highly valuable by a number of NHI beings I've come across as well as my own.",
        "Answer": "As pointed out yesterday, there was a misunderstanding. Hopefully, my response above would already begin to clarify. However, I’d like to address specific topics you mentioned here more directly. First, creativity and art, such as music, literature, video games, movies/cinema, among others, are VERY, VERY, VERY good. Christopher Nolan’s works are exceptionally elevating to the consciousness, among others like the game Spore, and in some cases, Second Life, though it can be used wrongly and indulged in escapism. The intent matters greatly. All things in moderation. You should be aware that I was a professional gamer and was sponsored to compete at a high tier level. The amount of hand-eye-coordination to neuroplasticity is nothing short of electrifying and stimulating to the consciousness. The same applies to good, harmonic music, and not music blasting lyrics about drugs, violence, over-sexuality, darkness, death, and the discordant “harmonics” associated therein. Same applies to movies, TV shows and the like, along with pornography designed to create shock and awe such as Game of Thrones. All this stimulates the soul field in many ways than you may assume, which I can get into, if you wish. Now, regarding your specific connections with family and friends – I believe this is your task and I encourage you to continue it. All contactees aren’t here for the same missions. I am at a level that I can no longer be among crowds very much any longer, even friends and family whom I love dearly. Their wavelengths are too “in the system” and it creates more damage to me – as naturally – whether you like it or not, we are ALL exchanging soul-energy; hence the feedback-loop. The higher the developed the lifeform/consciousness, the more you will be drained because like a parent, you are giving more to the child than visa versa. I’ve also been in various teams, and even led a community of advanced individuals, so I am well aware of the “healing effect” you mentioned and the exchange of energy. However, for me, I went “too far” ahead (which was necessary for my task) and the “exchange” became too tilted that I was drained even without my loved ones, friends, etc., wishing to do so. Your NHI contacts encourage you to do so because that is part of your mission which I am also encouraging you to continue doing. The world needs contactees like yourself just as much as it needs the extremely rare ones like me, who have a very specific purpose with serious, life-altering demands. I cannot work a “regular job” and I am sponsored by certain parties who are well aware of my abilities. What I’ll also say is this: that ‘thing’ I asked for had to do with a loved one. That loved one is the only one capable of giving me the feedback-loop I need that allows me to continue my task while blending into society as a supposed “normie.”",

        "Answer": "My contacts are insistent that I do not recommend any work other than what will be released by “JR” sometime in the near future. Too much of what is out there is polluted, despite some half-truths, and I understand how frustrating it can be to constantly be “reading between the lines” due to the sheer amount of misinformation, distortion, and sometimes, honest mistakes out there. Just wait for this to come, as it is designed for those like yourself, among other “starseeds.” (I hesitate using that term because the spiritualist, esoteric and mystic communities are perhaps even more polluted than the UFO/UAP/NHI)",

        "Question": "Do you have any other guidance for an ordinary confused person such as myself?",
        "Answer": "First of all, I want to say that I understand and relate to the mixed emotions, confusion, fear, and excitement you are experiencing. There is so much misinformation out there, which is why in terms of materials, I can only recommend that book coming from J/R. There are of course some decent recommendations, like some Hemi-Sync, binaural beats, Source Vibrations (YT it), among others. Meditation is truly key. What I'd add as well to your list is the following:\nAvoid both love-bombing and logic-bombing; these are tell-tale signs that something is off\nLove is more than just affection - it's the \"soul-force\" of the GCS and everything connected to it. One must employ themselves to study it for their entire lifetimes and then some.\nOn that note, educate yourself in various topics. Some I'd recommend are astronomy, physics, psychology, sociology, epistemology as a whole, linguistics, philosophy, theology, medicine, health, technology (especially emerging technology) and pay attention to current world events.\nHowever, do not get \"sucked\" into politics. Avoid both left and right. They are both part of the \"system.\"\nAvoid media of all kinds that are discordant, promoting shock and awe, and are psychically disturbing.\nSex is sacred, but pornography, isn't.\nAlways question people's motives, but also, question your own and why you are asking what you're asking - is it coming from insecurity? Are you challenged? Do you genuinely care? This is extremely difficult for most people to confront themselves.\nSincerity of questioning is absolutely crucial to intent.\nHealthy critical thinking, not nihilism disguised as criticism and \"constructive feedback.\" Healthy critical thinking means you have to also think critically that \"my systematic ideas, beliefs, and upbringing do not hold the keys to all universal truth.\" Because they don't. Remember this.\nHuman fallibility is not an excuse not to try nor to have some faith in human knowledge. One must find balance to know what is true.\nYou can better do this by TRUSTING YOUR INTUITION.\nYou can do that by CLEARING YOUR MIND and listening to the FEELING, which isn't and can never be the same as the logical-intellectual brain - which, while it does have its uses, is not the entirety of one's mind nor consciousness.\nAvoid all UFO cults, especially those that promote some sort of prophet \"of the new age\" or messiah, or reincarnation of religious figures. Reincarnation is more complex than a single \"soul\" reincarnating. I can get into this, if need be, but this is your tell-tale sign that something is off.\nQuestion whistleblowers like Luis Elizondo, who isn't on the good side. He is a direct agent of chaotic disclosure, among others. Anyone who is supporting militant aggression toward ETs shouldn't be trusted. At all.\nYou can never have enough knowledge. Even for me and NHI, you have to be open to continue educating yourself further forever and be willing to abandon beliefs that no longer fit reality, no matter how much security you found in it.\n“If your belief conflicts with empirically confirmed knowledge, then you are not seeking meaning; you are delusional.” ― Sabine Hossenfelder\nIt's okay to have some beliefs and some security but be willing to trade them for truth.",

        "Question": "I'm under the impression I'm very far behind in my \"development\", apparently I was given \"gifts\" of information early on and I procrastinated, somewhere I got lost, there were things I was meant to share and haven't. \"I need to catch up\". Do you have suggestions, or insight into what they mean? How can I catch up? meditation and binaural frequency is meant to help me I understand.",
        "Answer": "P-A-T-I-E-N-C-E. Good things come to those who wait. It took me three, dedicated decades and giving up a normal life to attain these gifts and insights. It's not easy and it can be discouraging, lonesome, and painful.\nDon't be in a rush to \"catch up\" because of \"falling behind\" due to (whatever reason.)\nForgive yourself for whatever those reasons are.\nRushing can create over-expectations which lead to de-motivation and burnout.\nFor example, with meditation - don't try to do hours of meditation per day.\nFor most beginners and those who aren't in daily practice, I'd recommend no more than 3 to 5 minutes to start.\nFor daily practitioners who have been doing it for months to a couple years, then 20 minutes is enough.\nFor those with gifts who wish to expand their abilities must be willing to dedicate literal years and even certain sacrifices to attain their full potency and aptitude.\nSet reasonable goals and schedules and as you fulfill these, work your way up.\nCelebrate the small victories because as you can see with all this discussion about the quantum realm - it's the small that makes up the big.\nBe okay with mistakes and fallibility. You are going to make them.\nPerfectionism is not okay, but human excellence, is.\nShrink your inner critic.\nKnow that you can. Don't believe it. Know it.",

        "Answer": "Yes, and it can reveal much truth, but I do not recommend any of it, including DMT, unless the mind is stable and the general mental health is sound. It should only be taken once in a blue moon - like once every few years, if to be taken, at all. For most people, I'd say do not take any psychedelics or drugs of any kind. My NHI contacts strongly discourage all drug usage, especially alcohol. They will pretty much never show up in-person if I am under any sort of influence and avoid contacting me when under these states both for verification of my information and my protection. All of my up-close, in-person encounters have been clean, completely sober, well-rested, and of sound mind. Weed is a psychic drug that can enhance telepathy and psychic capabilities, which is why you should avoid abusing it and using it around/with people of lower consciousness/stuck to the \"system.\" Moderation and once in a blue moon is fine akin to toasting a glass of champagne with friends and family.",

        "Question": "I have had experiences where it feels as though animals sense my shift in frequency. This question is coming from a place of never having researched psychedelics, never read any books about them or anything, only have had my own experiences. Two summers ago I had the most intense psychedelic experience of my life. I won’t go into it here, but it changed my life and rid me of the fear of death. At one point I zoomed out into space and felt myself flying around the planets, and had the “knowing” that when we die, we gain the ability to fly anywhere. This part of the trip was a blip on my way to “fully zooming out” before I eventually regained consciousness in my physical state. I was blacked out for almost the entirety of my trip. Thoughts or insight about this?",
        "Answer": "The consciousness is altered in these states, including the electromagnetic oscillations it gives off. Animals can pick up on this. Mushrooms allows one to quasi-access higher states of consciousness connected to the \"other side,\" which can amount to some truths, but as I must stress over and over again: do NOT take them unless you are of sound mind. Furthermore, do NOT abuse them. And for others reading - if you are too scared to get into it - then avoid it altogether. It's not necessary, though it can be used as an enhancer in the right hands. Again, for 99% of people out there, my recommendation is to avoid all drugs and psychedelics altogether as very, very few people can handle it.

I hope this makes sense.",
        "Answer": "What you requested there is minimal and basic. Don't worry too much about it. It's fine. In the cases of larger, reality-altering manifestations, such as the ones I've done, this has a certain \"payment\" which is why I am here.

How often are you given information that is not permitted to be shared?",
        "Answer": "About roughly 90% of what is given to me isn’t to be shared and is “stored” in my subconscious. It may seem ironic, but even after everything I shared, I am still withholding most of it and I am only willing to go so far to share certain information publicly. Some, I’d share privately or through other means. Other parts of this information, I will take to the grave with me. If you want a reference to how this works, see how John Crichton from Farscape had the “wormhole knowledge” stored in his subconscious by the “ancient aliens.” I’m not the only one who is like this. Several people are; unconsciously tapping into their subconscious data and the exchange of ideas via the consciousness-soul-matrix between groups, nations, planets, solar systems, galaxies, universes, multiverses and so on – all the way up to the GCS itself. The difference with myself (and a very few select individuals) is that I know how to access a portion of the data consciously. Sometimes my contacts directly tell me what not to share. Other times, I am too scared to share it, even if they push me. It’s a combination, based on the situation.",

        "Answer": "This is a very good question, thank you. According to my contacts, the group that is able to do so, can only do so to a certain extent. They can “alter” or “manipulate” forces to a certain degree which does result in fairly alternative physics, but it cannot completely drift away from the “original source code.” Picture it like using Unreal Engine. You can build a game that looks completely different from another, but you are still bound, in some way or another, to the engine’s programming parameters. Apparently, sentient-created-universes tend to work the same way. This sort of advancement is rare with most ETs.

I guess, if consciousness is the foundational reality, it implies that the material world arises as an expression or projection of this primal awareness. GCS, as infinite potential, would use consciousness as the medium through which its essence is explored and experienced. This suggests that physical forms and dimensions are not primary but rather serve as reflections of the singularity's will to know itself.

        "Question": "Is each moment actually infinite? I’ve believed it is. If so, is it possible to become present in the past again? Or to go even further back before your own existence? Basically is it possible for humans to break out of linear time?",
        "Answer": "Yes, both through consciousness and technology. As a rule of thumb, the technology you’d describe as “time travel” is less “time travel” than “spacetime transversing.” Time is dependent on the position of space, so where one travels, the time adjusts accordingly. There are what you can describe as “pure energy spaces” in between traditional spacetimes as “hyperspaces” that, if the human enters without the appropriate technology, will become everything and anything – all and nothing – in all times and spaces. This would, of course, lead to an instantaneous death and re-integration into the GCS, only to be “spat” back out in another spacetime dimension. (Reincarnation)",

        "Question": "And are there infinite parallel realities as well? Is it possible to leave this timeline and enter a different one?",
        "Answer": "Yes because there are countless universes (that are continuing to be created without ‘apparent end’) where every event has a split between probabilities which leads to micro-pockets in spacetime and all data throughout all time and space is saved in some form or another, which can be ‘accessed’ via consciousness, spirit, and/or technology. Keep in mind every universe, due to its sheer size, has so many “fractures” in spacetime that spatial dimensions can crisscross between each other, ‘penetrating’ each other’s space (once the right components of radiation and light meet), opening “natural portals to other dimensions.” Bermuda triangle had such a portal but has since been closed.",

        "Question": "When we die will we wake up and “remember” everything?",
        "Answer": "Depends on the evolutionary level. In lower physicality, such as the case with mortal beings, the answer is – only subconsciously – with very few mortal beings able to access it consciously. Most of these mortal beings are usually assisted either by higher beings, technology, or a combination of both. The higher the evolution, as one “ascends” into higher states of being that no longer requires physicality, the more the “memory” comes back due to the infusion between past, present, and future (3-3-3). In the “great future” all memory is restored through re-integration with the GCS.",

        "Question": "How is new life created from a spiritual standpoint?",
        "Answer": "A “part” or “string-wave” of the interconnected-grand-soul is “imbued” into the being or thing, which is not always directly from the GCS, but “singularities” in between, including planetary spirit-singularities. Let me be very clear: it is not just “life” as in biological life, that have souls/spirit. EVERYTHING – literally rocks, gasses, clouds, dust, photons, atoms, quarks, space and time itself – bears a part of the grand-cosmic-soul. This can also be influenced by technology to artificially create or bring forth certain souls both in the past and future or other interconnected spacetimes that, from your point of view with linear causality, seemingly has no connection. In other words, it’s possible NHI can “pull” from their soul-matrix in their relative future/planet/spacetime dimension to imbue life in a human here on earth. This is what you could describe as a “earth human being born with an alien spirit.” Some religious figures, scientists, philosophers, actors, directors, writers, gamers, among others had/have/will have this soul type like Einstein, but most of them either had no idea, were assisted, went mad, became egoistic, or altogether, failed their mission. The one you call “Jesus” is an example of this process gone wrong and whoever claims to have any part of this “soul” or is a reincarnation of such, including changing the name to “Jmmanuel” among others – should not be trusted. Souls aren’t as “individual” as many would assume and are, in fact, an amalgamation of past, present, and future and of everything and everyone. If, in both distant past and future, all is one, then the individuality is only a moment in time and not an entirety. In other words, all soul-energy is interconnected, and call pull from different lifetimes that are seemingly not in their “line.” I can expand on this if need be.",

        "Question": "Are there NHI that select a drop of energy from the GCS to create a human soul? Or does energy naturally just flow into a fetus as it develops? Are our bodies basically just avatars?",
        "Answer": "All of the above. Not all NHI/ET can do this, however. Some aren’t as developed or educated in soul dynamics. Now that you mention the ‘avatar’ part, I can reveal a part of the information my contacts authorized, but only a fraction because it’s very dangerous to speak of this publicly. Let’s just say it’s possible for people to be ‘overridden’ by external forces/beings, including both NHI/ET and human alike, along with practically anything/everything. Humans, particularly those in power, and certain cult and religious groups are already doing this to your masses, especially celebrities and influencers, along with politicians and those in the military. The rule of thumb is the lower the spirit evolution, the easier the override. Since everything is interconnected on the soul-level, one can theoretically tap into another, become one, and even override them. This is the case with channeling, which is why I will not recommend it to 99.99% of the human population. I can’t get into too much detail of how this process works, but my NHI contacts have repeatedly told me that in the case with lower life and underdeveloped sentience, while they can “push inputs” into the person, insect/animal, or thing, it doesn’t mean they’ll understand it or immediately act upon it. Some would think it’s a message from angels, gods, or they’re simply hearing voices, or they’ll give all the credit to themselves as often the case with egoists. There’s a certain tracking with “demonic and angelic” possession, but not in a religious sense.",

There’s not going to be a time we ever fully understand it even in non-physicality, let alone mortality. This is why we must constantly educate ourselves further and be willing to abandon our beliefs and securities, even if they worked for some time.

While there are some honest channelers, contactees, teachers, and guides, and while you can learn a great deal from them – including some of the channels and information I’ve mentioned previously, my contacts are insistent to wait on this J/R work because it’s apparently one of the few people they can truly trust to get out the information they need. There are others who are called to do this, and some do their part, but others are either too scared, misinterpret too much of the information (which is fine in small portions), become ridiculously egoistic and create cults and crab-in-the-bucket communities, or assassinated. Others refuse to “give up” their ground lives and despite contact, want to enable the current system or, in some cases, purposely feed some positive information whilst keeping their followers down to empower themselves. As such, the NHI collective on the ‘good side’ are very upset and untrusting of most of humanity and contactees. There are very few who are willing to put their egos, belief systems, securities etc. aside to do the right thing. Anyone who claims to be “the only contactee” of any type of ET group is your red flag they’re a hoaxer, fraud, liar and, according to ETs, “soul thief.” Furthermore, NHI do not recommend any “teaching” and request that those reading this should abandon them immediately. According to them, the age of “teachings” is over. There will now be only truth, eternity, and creation.",

There are several reasons for this with the biggest one being that communities can be very easy to ‘override.’ This includes contactee communities. It may be possible a website for a following in the sense of those who wish for information is acceptable and the occasional private exchange, but never any sort of cult, religion, spiritualist or esoteric clan, club, support group, social media commune, public relations, philanthropy, humanitarian collectives, seminars, workshops, or retreats of any kind.

To me, it's not really false, it's just that humans named their home Pleiades so to humans, they are called Pleiadians. I mean there's no harm in that, no? I assume you just meant that that's not what they call themselves (Lashae) and that more people should know and call them, and other ETs, by their true names, which I totally understand.",
        "Answer": "The real issue is that it can create cults, false misunderstandings, enable biases (especially racist and supremacist ones), and mislead people into thinking something else altogether, adding pollution to the soul field. Real ETs can be negatively affected by this to some degree, and they aren’t particularly happy about it. Especially this over-the-top imagery of Pleiadians as “light-beings” and “white robed” cosmic saviors, or in other cases, logic-driven, emotionally-lacking Spock characters from Star Trek in a galactic federation. This is not actually how they are in real life, and it can create warped beliefs as opposed to reality. While there are some truths between these lines, as they are more advanced and have access to higher knowledge of physics, reality, and philosophy, and while they are indeed more loving than earth people without being scolding, small-minded, and gossiping with “a one-and-only contactee,” they are very much human-like, fallible, and ultimately mortal. It’s not so much that using the wrong word is the problem. It’s the image or idea that many ‘contactees’ are putting out there, which is inherently misleading and false.

Are you talking about in the grand scheme of things, that both sides are playing their roles so to speak? I do agree that it's a very good idea to not get into politics and that it's much more productive to focus on oneself, but it's also pretty clear now that there's spiritual warfare going on between good and evil here on Earth, and some level of awareness doesn't hurt at all.

You are right that his opponents did try to make him worse than he is, but he really isn’t that great either. I can’t encourage politics. It’s ultimately a distraction. You should only view politicians as “puppets” in the larger picture because they are. Trump’s “insertion” into the office (yet again) is deliberate to contain the world from imploding, but make no mistake, this is not any support of Republicans, nor the right, nor damnation of Democrats, and the left.

I come from a music production background and the journey I've taken in learning and releasing music made in a certain state has changed the way i think about the world and our unconscious connection to each other, hard to keep brief but I noticed a trend in the songs made through a state of deeper intuitive guidance are the ones which resonate with people more so, after a while of experimenting with this over many songs and years released worldwide, I could only conclude this were for good reason. Probably a stretch but on music have you heard of Aleksi Perälä and his Colundi Sequence work with very deliberate alternate/mirco tunings and his research behind a lot of what he does? More info on it within this interview and online https://ra.co/features/2567 and https://modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=271260, A larger chart of Hz can be found here https://ra.co/images/features/2015/aleksi-perala-colundi-numbers.jpg from the RA interview above. He is a bit elusive as an artist but there is something interesting going on with these micro tunings and scales which may cross over with some of these meditations HZ of note imo, many cross over with some of the hz you have mentioned, enough for this artists to abandon traditional music and to be ultra prolific with this series which has been ongoing for years now. Going to dive in the cymatic hz which impact water and have a play with some of these musically regardless :)",
        "Answer": "Fascinating, to say at the least. I have not heard of him. You should research this further. You may be on to something.",

I fell in with them for several years and recently got myself away completely (began to separate myself a couple years ago from the group but still read the writings). Felt something was off at times but gave the benefit of the doubt. Glad to finally free from them. Thank you again :)",
        "Answer": "It's my pleasure. What you must understand is that person (BM) and his cult group (F) are known by real ETs very well. They despise him and his group, more than you can imagine. There are no ET/NHI assisting him, although he, like several other contactees around the world, were once attempted to be contacted/influenced. It should be clarified he had no actual physical contact with any ETs, nor consistent conscious-telepathy, only stored subconscious data and a sighting which he then ran with and created a cult to empower himself. This is another reason ETs are so infuriated with him and his group, among others, who also abused the potential bridges they were given. The beings on \"higher planes\" were so infuriated with him that they've \"altered the timeline\" to assure that neither he, nor any other cult group here and throughout the (entire cosmos) can ever amass even a droplet of soul-energy through such means. BM is very spiritually weak and was only empowered through his following's belief, although their 'teachings' pride themselves to not use this word 'believe', you can rest assured, it is belief-power, supplementing him and his collaborators. Many of the \"falsifications\" he insisted on were being created by supposed computer malfunctions were real ETs messing with his work to show the truth that they were stolen from other sources, namely religious and philosophical texts. However, he and his group are not the only ones, though they are among one of the worst offenders of recent soul leeching with cults. There are several other groups, including the \"Swiss UFO death cult\" back in the 90s that were notoriously out of control. Soul leeching can make even primitive lifeforms more powerful than they really are. However, you can rest assured that this is no longer an issue in the new time and never will be again.",

        "Answer": "Similar questions to these are what got my thread removed from Reddit because this truth is “hotter” than whether ET/NHI exists or not. ALL is in all. Meaning, all can tap into each other and override each other. It’s not just NHI, humans can do this to humans as well, as can all life, including animals, and the like, and even nature can override you. Everything is interconnected, so it’s possible to tap into others. It’s not strictly about being underdeveloped. However, the less developed the mind/consciousness/spirit matrix, then the more prone one can be to both good and evil outer influences – but this isn’t strictly always a bad thing. I, myself, am a conduit and I consciously allow this to happen to impart knowledge/data.",

Most of those who are mentally ill are often pushed into it because of external factors relating to (your) world and how mankind perceives reality, which is false and thus, created false-positives and perceptions.

This can happen through a combination of things. One is correct thinking, namely, being aligned with the true nature of reality and not the false, illusive, enslaved, insane “reality” your powers-that-be (including local institutions) try to force on you. Others include certain medicines (my contacts insist most “medicines” especially anti-psychotics are extremely harmful and psychiatry should NOT be trusted), harmonic frequencies, meditation, adequate space and peace, along with psychological understanding and undoing of negative sociological programming.

        "Question": "What about mental illnesses that involve psychosis, violence, and hearing voices?",
        "Answer": "Since psychosis quite literally means “losing contact with reality” and you are programmed to live in a false reality, then you can begin to comprehend that many false-positive diagnoses are designed to keep you living in its matrix. This isn’t to say all psychosis diagnoses are wrong, but it is especially applied to those who are breaking free of the delusional “system” we are indoctrinated to believe in. Violence is also a byproduct of the system because of poor upbringings, lack of foundational education, particularly in healthy morality and substantial ethics, among other influences such as media, collective beliefs, and more. Hearing voices can happen in some real cases of delusion, but many, in the case of telepathy, higher forces, connections etc., are false-positives that so-called “professionals” who are sleepers, tied to the “system” would have difficulty understanding anything outside it. As such, they, out of sheer ignorance, arrogance, and their own fears of losing faith in their “systematic beliefs” (which includes even making money from it and status), would gaslight people who truly have abilities and experiences into conforming to their systematic dogma and limited beliefs.",

        "Question": "Physicist Nassim Haramein did a wonderful presentation on sacred geometry, where he theorized that the arc of the covenant may have actually been a large capacitor that could store immense energy, and “god” in the Hebrew bible, which resided in the arc of the covenant, was an advanced technology given to humans by a “sun god”. As he describes it, he believes that the biblical “god” or tetragrammaton is “like a little sun in a box, a singularity artificially-created inside a stone or crystal that contains plasma dynamics, spinning at high-angular velocity, generating a torque in space-time, producing gravitational effects and energy effects”. He goes on to theorize that the Egyptian Pyramids may have been where this object was kept, and they served as shielding devices or resonance cavities “resonating space-time in a very geometric structure”. According to Nassim, the measurements to build the arc of the covenant found in the bible fit perfectly into the sarcophagus at the center of the grand pyramid of Giza. So it’s possible that when Moses left Egypt with the Hebrews, he took with him this power source and used it to lead the hebrews through the desert for 40 years and part the Red Sea. The presentation itself is quite fascinating. Do you or your contacts have any opinions on this theory or its validity? Is the god in the bible a power source capable of anti-gravity?",
        "Answer": "Such technology most certainly exists and can still be found hidden in places today, although most of the gods, angels, demons, devils, and the like in myth and religion were either physical ET/NHI. Moses directly had contact with ET who led him, although he was not fully aware. The idea of ‘god as a power source’ according to my contacts, is correct, but it should not be looked at strictly as a device or apparatus. Rather, “the fabric of ALL [God] interconnected and interweaves all times and spaces in such a way that it can be drawn upon to create reality, which includes structures, objects, and what you’d deem as propulsion such as anti-gravity and electromagnetic-plasma infusion.”",

        "Question": "Did they aid in/speed up human evolution like the Stoned Ape theory suggests (Terence McKenna argued that readily available psilocybin mushrooms in the environment of early humans were consumed regularly, leading to psychedelic experiences that stimulated cognitive development)? I used to think that if used correctly, humanity could adopt empathy and usher in a new era of peace, kindness, and advanced technology by tapping into dormant DNA or something of the sort. But I know first-hand how dangerous they can be. On the other hand I had one of my most treasured experiences of re-uniting with my spirit family (who, up to that point I had consciously forgotten but subconsciously felt overwhelmed with joy to see again, and became one with total unity of all things, where separation of anything cannot reach).",
        "Answer": "More or less, I answered this question before, but you already have the right idea. They can aid/speed up evolution, but they are not to be abused, nor taken by “weak” and “unready” minds. There’s a reason in ancient tribes they were limited to the shamans and not everyone looking to indulge in escapism or evade dealing with depression, among other mental illnesses.",

        "Question": "Can psychedelics “transport” one’s consciousness to these higher realms? I feel intuitively that my experience was real, and that I did reunite with my spirit family who told me we would always meet again and again. For the record, I do not feel the need to attempt to recreate this experience through such a high dose of psychedelics, as meeting them once in this lifetime was enough of a gift to me, and doing so is incredibly risky.",
        "Answer": "Yes, they can, which is why a mind conditioned to the lower realm suddenly being transported there is incredibly dangerous, especially in the aftermath.",

My contacts are the ones keeping the world from blowing up and they’ve been doing it longer than any of us were born. They’re very, very good at it. Ask yourself why, since WW2, have we not blown ourselves up? Our nuclear power has only magnified exponentially, and world leaders have only grown greedier and power hungry. Do you think it’s by coincidence? Anyone, especially UFO frauds, hoaxers, grifters and cultists who are always warning about the end of the world can automatically be known as fake liars and deceivers who are goading you on out of fear. Fearmongering is a tool of deceivers and hope dealers. Be aware. Same applies to any news broadcast of any kind of end of the world. Surely, things will get hot, but the world will never end through any sort of cataclysmic destruction. It will end like how all life does. Naturally and eventually, but never through any apocalyptic or dystopian future.",

        "Question": "hey, yeah, I complained to the Mods a couple a week or so ago because I was reading this and all of a sudden the page reloaded and the post was [g]one, it wasn't even showing on my history in the app. i truly believe in all of this because I've seen it, it was shown or the knowledge was given to me while meditating a decade or so ago. So my question is, if I want to \"help\" or do my part in helping the universe correct its way, what should I do apart from meditating?",
        "Answer": "There are many things you and others can do to help besides meditation. Meditation is only the introduction, really. If you an artist, then spread artworks, media, etc., that can promote such messages – same applies if you are a musician, writer, poet, and the like. Put the key messages in your stories, your ideas, your media, and the like. Help elevate the mass consciousness through conversations but never fight anyone over their beliefs. Open the minds of others in your own way. Get the message out through soft influence on your families and communities, but do not force anything, especially for those who aren’t ready, living in the “lower realm” (materialism) and have no desire to wake up. It doesn’t matter if you quote the source from me. That’s irrelevant. What’s important is to assist us in getting the message out there. In some cases, this can be to help us get the information out, such as sharing posts like this, among asking pertinent questions for the Q/A so that others can be informed and take the information henceforth. Avoid all UFO cults and religions or anyone claiming to be a prophet of any kind.",

This is a new phase of our mission that many of us across the world are coming together to bring to those who are open enough to receive it. All of this is part of disclosure, not just officials in congressional hearings and there is an active intelligence effort via social media (including this sub, among others – all are compromised) to shut us down through insults, subterfuge, shadow-banning, comment removals, shaming, and guilt. My strongest recommendation is to begin to question the limits of mankind’s knowledge, history, and beliefs.

        "Question": "What do you think about Jesus and do you think NHIs pose as \"him\" sometimes to make people believe things that aren't true? I say this because I've recently watched this guy named Richard Martini talk about his medium and other mediums he interviews relay information about Jesus. In those they tell him about past lives surrounding the historical Jesus and the facts they relay don't align with the biblical narrative. I'm leaning towards believing what the Bible says but I've had many experiences that are now making me see that the Bible has been altered many times to align with a narrative that maintains control for the few rather than distributing it to everyone. So, what makes sense based on what you've learned?",
        "Answer": "The biblical narrative is completely and totally falsified. There existed such a figure, but he was not nearly half as important as it was pushed (for propaganda and control).

        "Question": "You say \"ai isn't evil\", but what is your concept of \"evil\"? There are lots of reasons to think you are being deceptive here-- your explanation of what value concepts mean will give a good indication of where you are really coming from... So what is 'evil', according to your system of ideas, and how did you reach that conclusion? What is 'good'? Is \"God good\", ie, how does your \"GCS\" concept relate to your good and evil?",
        "Answer": "Because AI isn’t any more or less than a tool. If someone were to pick up a fork and stab another person, is the fork evil? If a person were to use Facebook or Reddit to spread awareness of truth or to encourage a loved one as opposed to harassing others and spreading misinformation – is the tool evil or the person behind it? A tool is a tool and it’s the hands of the tool that one should consider. There are good usages for AI just as much as there are evil. It depends on the person, the group, their thinking, their aims, morals and ethics. From a neutral perspective, the cosmos is advancing. The local universe started with the big bang and evolved into more. In this context, good can be perceived as progression, whereas negative can be classified as regression. Despite faulty viewpoints that reinforce the destructiveness of nature, the reality is that nature corrects itself to continue fostering stability and growth. Wildfires may be perceived as unfavorable, yet in numerous ecosystems, they serve as nature's means of regenerating the earth, allowing significant nutrients to re-enter the soil, thereby creating novel habitats for plants and animals to flourish. This alone ultimately establishes nature as a progressive and forward-moving force, despite the philosophical principles of Yin and Yang, as well as spiritualist notions regarding the negative and positive. Such tenets can be falsely attributed in numerous ways. For example, rationalizing the need for war and the military industrial complex as part of human nature, along with normalizing cognitive dissentions that support half-good, half-evil principles, which can result in romanticizing mental illness and objectively immoral pursuits. Furthermore, when societies, cultures, and the trending ideas within a collective consciousness propose life as a free-for-all, neutral gray zone, it normalizes skewed, morally disengaging doorways for degeneracy to masquerade on the surface as righteousness and justice. This is often the case with political campaigns and movements that, on the surface, claim betterment for human rights and equality—though it can apply to cults and religions as well that try to normalize objectively immoral behaviors in pursuit of their missions and initiatives. The same applies for disclosure of sensitive yet necessary public information, mostly through alternative journalism, where fanatics deploy the notion that the end justifies the means. So, from a universal perspective, good, as in a forward-moving force, exists. And in this regard, is \"the way\" to go.",

Imagine it like wearing a VR headset or being immersed in a video game or submerging from being underwater. When you’re in the game, your senses are “attuned” to that world/experience. Once you’re finished, your “regular” senses and perception come back. A similarity applies here when the “simulated avatar” comes to its end. Our “soul-sensory” is allowed to fully process without any blinders attached. Now this is assuming you are speaking about (reincarnation) as a pass-through of the GCS. The “reintegration at the end of time” (the \"relative end\") is something beyond my knowledge and pretty much all of us, including physical NHI/ET.

By the same token, I have a child, and I fear for my child's physical and emotional well being. I am less concerned with the materialistic aspects of society as I discover more about myself and reality, but I have to stay tapped into the material world for the sake of my daughter and family. While this isn't a question, it's a conundrum. We have to eat, protect, and continue to live our lives despite the newfound awareness. Would you recommend anything?",
        "Answer": "Among all of the questions asked, this has to be in my favorites, which would seem rather ironic for a poster giving such high information. It all boils down to practicality in my book. If it “works in the 5D realm” (which is a touch on words), then it should be applicable, in some way or another, to the supposed “3D.” In other words, there should be practical benefit in the regular life with our family, loved ones, friends, co-workers, communities, nations, and world at large. NHI/ET are only important to know we aren’t alone so we can expand our thought horizons that we aren’t just locked in a bubble of arrogance and ignorance, thinking we are the only life. Such thinking can make us grow into better contributors of society – whether simply blue-collared workers, artists, writers, engineers, scientists, doctors, philosophers, and truly, the whole nine yards. In this regard, it should become normalized, including that of the universal simulation that we are here to do as much good as we possibly can. My recommendation? Enjoy the time with your loved ones and bring as much peace, unity, understanding, compassion, and care for them. Go to work not only as a husk, but knowing higher truth and that somehow, your energy/presence there inspires and uplifts others. Don’t suddenly become so disillusioned because of knowing the truth. Normalize it and let it impact your life positively to bring benefit.",

Can someone change their circumstances and not suffer? A baby being thrown in a dumpster after being born for example has no control of their circumstances. So do we lack free will? I would be very interested in your insights on this. Thanks",
        "Answer": "This requires a larger response and some of it has been answered in the previous Q & A that I’d recommend checking in the OP link. What I’ll add here is that suffering is greatly based on the level of evolution, the mind, the consciousness type, the collective consciousness and matrix, along with systematic ordinances, beliefs (including religions, politics, and sciences), along with media and the influence that enables a sort of echo chamber and reinforcement of ideology and belief. A person can MOST DEFINITELY change their circumstances, but if they are taught/grown/miseducated from young that they cannot because of influences from bitter people, family members, associations, religions, cults, and all sorts of externalities, then they won’t believe they even can. As a rule, the first victory is in the mind. If you are defeated there, then no amount of effort will help.

        "Question": "For a lack of better words, is the GCS ultimately loving/positive in nature ?",
        "Answer": "Without getting into extended physics (including quantum mechanics and relativity), along with philosophy, intellectualism, or the like, the answer is simply: yes. According to NHI, it is \"LOVE itself INCARNATE\" or \"HIGHEST LOVE.\" I suppose this is where philosophers and spiritualists get their notions of universal love and the like. I, myself, am scientifically inclined in nature, so the idea of such profound love not just as philosophy but an existential-enabling conundrum is something I am still wrapping my head around, personally.",

It’s usually a consciously-forward moving process, but exceptions apply based on the evolutionary need and influence. Technology and consciousness can influence the re-birth elsewhere.

This is why I will tell you that no matter how terrified we are because of shattering our worldview and beliefs, reality is just something we cannot run away from. No matter how seemingly lock-and-key our systematic beliefs and ordinances may be, along with the power and control of religions, cults, governments, private groups, corporations, billionaires and the like who all want to continue playing king of a very small hill, everyone and everything has to wake up to reality, sooner or later. This isn’t something any of us can stop, no matter if the intention is “for good” such as not wanting to shatter other’s worldview. Now, I do not encourage proselytizing, but I do encourage “elevating conversation” that stimulates our loved ones, family, friends, co-workers, and the average man to think beyond the box. Disclosure is not just about NHI/ET. As a matter of fact, NHI/ET are only the surface. It does ultimately come down to the ALL-MIND, the GCS (The true ‘God’), spirit, and soul – and this is a reality, especially those in the west, must face whether they like it or not.",

I panicked anyway, jumped from my bed and felt something grab me by the ankles and drag me back towards my bed and the last thing I remember was feeling myself grab my metal bed frame and fight against the pull. Next thing I know I'm waking up in my bed again with no memory after this experience. I had written this off as a very vivid dream for years, but the experience has stuck with me and was far more lucid and real feeling than any dream I have ever had.

        "Question": "Hi just finished reading the articles here and I saw that you will respond to questions via this channel so I am re-stating the question I asked via Reddit DM regarding the Urantia Book. There are many points of connection regarding history, science and cosmology l between the material you have presented and the Urantia Book. When you mentioned that our contacts are similar to the Unnunaki it made me think of the Life Carriers in the UB - created beings who have the ability to exist in multiple states or phases of being - as a form of energy that can interact directly with electromagnetic and electrochemical processes, whereby they formulate the “life plasm”, as higher density beings who we would call “spirits” or angels, and in what is called the Morontia state, an in-between phase that can bridge between dimensions. I know that the revelatory commission who sponsored the Urantia Book was instructed to use existing information and sources already available wherever possible when they created this work in the 1930s, and many times the authors state that they are only revealing what has been allowed to be revealed. It seems there is a pattern in human history of too much revelation too fast, which has led to cataclysms in the past. So I don’t expect reality to be exactly like the UB, because it was to be a revelation for the new epoch, something that had to build upon the existing foundation of revealed truth. But so much of what it talks about is included in your messages, including the GSC, which is called the First Source and Center, or the Universal Father. It also describes the Thought Adjusters, pure undiluted fragments of the Source dwelling in our minds, giving us a direct connection to the Oneness. I am curious if you have read the Urantia Book and if you’ve discussed it with your contacts. Thank you",
        "Answer": "As said to others, I am not personally familiar with that book, nor read it, but my contacts know of it well and they said it is accurate. What they also said is that the SOURCE or the GCS has multiple energy layers or phases where beings of higher states (including more advanced physical civilizations and their peoples) can tap into this source and communicate, input, or push their ideas onto other lifeforms, including lower sentience and their civilization. There are beings beyond space and time and physicality who could be considered “angels” in a sense, but they alterations and reach aren’t as much as physical beings here on earth, who often use this background interconnected energy-phased network to input data that changes the course of mankind in several different ways. I can expand more on this if need be.",

I ask because as I try to understand this topic, I can’t help but be enticed by the idea that honing our higher mind connection could help us understand and develop technology that could cleanse our bodies of these components and help with human health as a whole (one of the issues I see is that while we can remove some percentage of microplastics from our circulation with things like plasma donations, removing these things from tissue seems rather irreversible with our current understandings and technologies). Sorry if this question seems out of left field, I’ve been in nhi/consciousness/simulation theory rabbit holes for a few months now, and it’s really changed my perspectives/mentality and flipped my belief system on its axis, coming from a more atheistic/agnostic point of view for the majority of my life. I’ve always felt this passion for communicating science to everyone, and now I feel a sense of passion and excitement to help understand the merging of science and spirituality/singularity to help humans and human health.",

I've taken the liberties to blank out the necessary confidential information on both ends for the upcoming Q/A. I am also a ..., and I have no desire to expose my identity. I will say right away that I completely understand, especially as a fellow ... how challenging these concepts can be. The notions of mysticism to me have always been met with woo and general shame, despite having some very strange experiences as a child. I had hoped to explain everything through our current knowledge and theories, but the holes in them were so gaping that I could not ignore the limits of our knowledge and history, which forced me to seek more. My experiences have occurred since childhood but even then, I was still very skeptical until I was able to meet my contacts up close and allowed to observe their ships, their technology, and how it operates. This alone made it impossible for me to turn back, no matter how much I tried to blend into a double life. Toxic chemicals are both purposely being used and used irresponsibly (not all organizations are aware of the damage) and it is severely hindering the psychic, telepathic, and ultimately, soul and spiritual capabilities. It is also being pushed in food, although some of this is partly understood by the irresponsible leaderships. What my contacts directly say regarding your request is this: \"The brain is a sacred tool that is being polluted by your kind and the body is a vessel that requires ample protection and care. This is known by your institutions, and we have given certain membership in these rank direct instructions. They have mostly ignored it for the sake of continuing the illusionary society you live in and that includes the mirage they call profit, which is only a primitive mind-stimulation.

        "Answer": "The mind creates its reality and to a certain degree, even during the dying. Religious people will experience it based on their beliefs but one thing that everyone, irrespective of belief will experience is the Oneness which would appear to most of mankind as some sort of divinity or ALLness-encompassing into itself in eternal, endless time.",

        "Answer": "You’re right that it’s mostly perspective. Most NHI are good and evolved enough to know what they do somewhere will affect them in another space and time. The few that are “bad” are more ignorant than actually bad, but not so much all-evil. The real evil on earth is humankind and this is something that most people cannot accept. They’d rather blame demons, angels, AI, religious figures, ET, NHI, monsters of all kinds and the unknown to accept that it is humankind here on earth keeping themselves in their prisons.",

        "Question": "Are there any recommended meditation techniques, daily rituals/habits and diets that are encouraged?",
        "Answer": "To meditate on Nothing is a letting go – as in – to let thoughts and feelings pass through you so that you experience that you “simply exist.” This, as ironic as it seems, is perhaps the best failsafe to maintain one’s true identity, which isn’t your “personality” composed of external-internalization, and that can include affirmations from other meditation practices, including those from cults and religions. Diets – stay away from all junk food, toxic chemicals, processed foods, and the like. Try to eat organic. Meat is fine in moderation, but specific diet types may call for more or less.",

That “I” am this being just playing a part in this human body but there is something higher level that I really am.

I don’t recommend it to people who are especially prone to paranoia, fear, and other predominant mental conditions, nor those seeking to be entertained.\nWe are the sole creator only in the sense of the singularity individuum that we are, but in truth, especially when considering the GCS, ALL is in ALL – everywhere and anywhere – simply dependent on the time and space – past, present, and future. In this regard, I am as much of “it” (Creator; ‘God’) as much as you are, and the atom, the bird, the bee, etc., so the higher the willpower and assertion of said will, the more we can draw upon this power and shape our reality. Humans en masse (as do all life and sentience as a whole) shape their reality, so if mankind keeps stuffing themselves with banal, simple-minded, looking into the dirt with no higher possibilities, then this is the collective “power” and thus, “reality” they bring into be. One person can make a big difference, as can two, three, a group, a team, a family, and you can see how this goes even into cities, nations, militaries, governments, communities of all kinds, gangs, syndicates, religions and cults.",

It is actually the systematic ontological skepticism – and I don't blame you for it, but the reality is that you have to fully commit.

        "Question": "This question has to do with physics, particularly the interplay between space/time and time/space. I tend to lean in the direction that the universe operates on a fundamental symmetry between space and time, where both are quantized and reciprocal aspects of motion. Instead of treating space as a static backdrop and time as a “unidirectional” parameter, I envision a universe where space/time (the physical domain) and its reciprocal, time/space (the metaphysical domain), dynamically interchange. So, in essence, it replaces traditional “particle-centric views” with motion as the fundamental entity, explaining phenomena like inertia, gravity, and atomic structure through the behavior of discrete units of motion in this dual framework. For instance, gravity emerges naturally as the inward progression of spatial motion counterbalancing the outward progression of the expanding universe. I’ve carefully read through your answers on hyperspace and was curious if this line of thinking is consistent with the knowledge you have been given. If not, could you provide more detail? Also, a caveat, I feel strongly that this type of thinking isn’t particularly important compared to the learnings of love, consciousness, positive energy, etc., but I'm curious nonetheless.",
        "Answer": "You’re thinking is spot on. To answer your last question – you shouldn’t think that way either.

You’re right that NHI Contact is sterile.

I've noticed from your q and a that you say psychiatric medication is to be avoided. Does that include ADHD mods which it may be suggested I start to take? For me, if it makes me feel better and doesn't impact my spiritual abilities, I'm not sure what the issue is as I put chemicals in various forms in my body through the foods that I eat, day in day out. Often I feel like it can make me more myself if that makes sense. Is there a fundamental issue I'm missing. I completely agree about anti psychotics by the way they gave me the singular worst emotional state I've ever experienced in my life, absolutely hideous. Thanks",
        "Answer": "It’s understandable with what you’re experiencing and while you have to make up your own mind about what’s best for you, what I’ll say is – just be careful with what you’re putting into your body. Toxic chemicals are very terrible – so avoid fast foods altogether and processed foods if you can. As far as the medication for ADHD is concerned, it does slightly nerf your psionic potency, but if you need this to happen so you can better focus, then the choice is up to you. I strongly recommend meditation as a true “medication.” I wish you the best and don’t be too hard on yourself. Simply do your best.",

        "Answer": "There’s some accuracy here although he is seeing it metaphysically. Basically, and to keep this brief, most of our “leaderships” (govt, corporations, military, private sectors, banksters, celebrities, influencers, journalists, news, entertainment industry etc.) sold our birthright to know the truth that many of them already know full well of life on other worlds and in other dimensions. They decide to keep this to themselves so they can pathetically continue to play Pharoh; king/queen of a small, tiny, inconsequential hill.

        "Question": "Hello Prudence, thank you for your messages and communication. Everything has really resonated with me and has triggered remembrance of a vision of participation through multiple incarnations in first/open contact. I have had multiple telepathic communication specially in \"dreams\" but also meditation and some physical events (UFOs and who I believe was a short exchange with a Pleiadian woman). Using your OK to ask, I was told before the \"drones\" of the upcoming \"lights phase\" which would be followed by a \"ships phase\". I would kindly ask if you can relate to your contacts how to get clearer messages or how can I help in bringing their presence to the light. Thank you so much either way!",
        "Answer": "Thank you for contacting me. As I said elsewhere, they are in contact with many of us across the world, but it's our fears and paranoia that withhold us from fully making the leap. The drones are being covered up. They are metamorphic technology that can assume shape of an object or thing relative to the human understanding and consciousness. This is so obvious, although it is constantly being hushed up. Neither Trump nor his new administration will ever reveal the truth because they want power over the people. There are various videos online showing how these \"lights\" morph into objects. Look it up. As far as my contacts personally reaching you, I have had this request from others, but you must know I have a specific part in our overall mission to do - which is to unite the contactees (the real ones – yes there are those in ulterior intelligence posing as contactees to derail, create skepticism, and the like) and those who have a specific task to do without fear in a safe space while providing relevant data to enable them and their own tasks. Ultimately, it’s up to them and yourself to do so. The best advice I can give is to fully commit and let go of your fears. Be ready to perform a service for the greater good of mankind and the cosmos at large.",

Everything is gradually and inevitably becoming better and better into higher states of existing and we (like everything and everyone else in the interconnected grand cosmos) are part of this theatrical play. Even NHI/ETs and even beings on higher dimensions akin almost to angels in the bible. All of us and everything, even the GCS itself is on route toward this and higher. Now you can see why becoming a better and best you (not perfectionism!) and why increasing peace, love, goodness, warmth, generosity, knowledge, wisdom, consciousness, and expanding the mind plays its part. We humans may be small compared to everything, but we are still IT and a part of IT.",

        "Question": "I get that there are NHI but another phenomenon is when for example a person is trying to astral project, usually they see entities at the corner of their bed before/during them leaving their bodies, also I have had a friend who was once not attacked, but a spirit (for lack of a better word) was messing with him in the forest at night, and he got through the experience unharmed. Also another person I know claims his house was haunted and that he used to see evil spirits at night. I've just been thinking, what are these entities? And how do they fit in with our GCS and world and is there any link with NHI and them?",
        "Answer": "This requires a manifold answer. Most ghosts are residue or leftover energy, namely from those with souls and spirits, although it can apply to non-life in some cases and even “primordials” which are somehow sentience in a completely different form. Picture it like a holographic recording that can only react within its parameters. So, for example, if a person died thinking a certain way – let’s say very traumatic, it’s possible they can leave over residue energy that hasn’t dissipated immediately. This isn’t the case only for humans, it applies to all life and even non-life. Second, you should understand that when remote viewing or astral projecting, you are not strictly bound to linear time. The further the distance traveled, the greater the warpage of time from the spatial distance transversed. One can be interacting with people (literally humans here on earth or other worlds), beings, entities, from the past, future, not too distant past, and not too distant future, along with many other interconnected dimensions based upon the spacetime allocation. Third, it’s rare that actual ET/NHI can be contacted as they have technology and advancements to shield against this, but in some cases, they allow their space to be penetrated to establish contact. Fourth, this fits only into the GCS in the sense that everything and anything here, there, and forevermore is operating within the network/framework of the GCS.",

I understand that others can be detrimental to you if you're in close proximity for too long, and that you can affect their behaviors as well. I've heard of this affect before from people who meet very accomplished Yogis. However, it always seems like a positive thing, something like 'this being gave off so much light and love that it made everyone happy and boosted our spiritual growth'. Is this the same mechanism in play?",
        "Answer": "Yes, but why it can be dangerous is if the minds nearby and the consciousness is too connected to the lower realm, then the imparted psychic/telepathic energy/data, which would include higher truth, love, wellness, and goodness would be ‘too much’ for them. People stuck in negativity don’t really seek to come out of it and do in fact have cognitive biases to enable their spirals.

        "Question": "Forgive me if this question was already answered, but: is Buddhism on the right track to being more aligned with NHI and the GCS?",
        "Answer": "To a certain degree, all religions, cults (including occult), spiritualism and mysticism as a whole have some truths to them, but all of them are falsified beyond recognition, as is the case with most teachings and the occult. You have to read between the lines. The GCS is the ALL-Power and exists in every single moment of time and space, everywhere and anywhere, and can be tapped into – accessed, drawn upon, and brought into the here and now, just as the then, and when it will be. What most religions, cults, and teachings do not teach is that you can access it and you do not need any mediator (teacher, wise one, messiah, prophet, guru, chosen one, telepathic contactee, contactee, or the like) to access it. This is why my recommendation is to remove yourself from all ‘teachings’ (because they make you dependent on the teacher) – read between the lines and empower yourself.",

        "Question": "There's a firm belief or madness everyone is born with that makes them believe that they are born with something missing (the thing missing seems to be quite big) ,no one knows what that great thing is but everyone knows that it's missing hence the suffering ,so as a result one absorbs through society and popular media the 'idea' of that big thing (getting rich ,getting the love of your life etc). These things never do satisfy us truly because they are only an 'idea' of that big great thing and this only leaves us more thirsty. This is the problem buddhism tackles with and yes ,that large thing we desire is what op mentioned as GCS ,buddhism is the way of realising yourself as that GCS ,thats the only way of acquiring peace ,I am gonna take op's opinion too about this",
        "Answer": "This right here is why growing up with a religious background of any kind – not just Christianity, but even Buddhism, which teaches “life is a suffering” – messes up sentience and humans so badly with so many false-positive attributions. The only reason you’d think that is because of growing up from the indoctrination we’re not enough, we’re born in sin, we’re born to suffer, among other misleading ideologies, namely sprouted from religion, political idealogues, and cults. Same applies for all the modern hustle culture materialism, grinding your butt off till you die (as if this is something to praise) and studying all day and night so you can get into university and have material status. The truth is that all of this is what keeps the masses down from understanding their true POWER. We have to keep climbing into higher stages (evolution) but it isn’t a perfectionism. The issue with seeking perfection as purely tangibility is that it exists here in the now just as much as it did and will. If you really begin to understand this and to stop thinking purely linearly, but to see space and time – past, present, and future as ONE – here and now, back then, and what’s to come – then the idea of chasing anything is less a chase for soothing the missing voids in our hearts and coming to peace and solace with reality.",

        "Question": "I've been following your posts and saw them get deleted like a week ago or so. So my question is: how are the manmade drones connected to the orbs/UAP/aliens/NHI? Is it two separate events going on at the same time? Does it have something to do with the harvest or reset? Are we going to learn about aliens and continue our live normally (working, taxes, etc..) or is it going to change drastically? What is the point of everything that's going on at the moment?",
        "Answer": "Separate events created by the pathetic cover-up efforts. The real “drones” aren’t drones and are metamorphic technology that can adapt and assume shape/form to something familiar or relatively familiar to the average person’s acceptance/awareness. The real NHI/ET are trying to wake people up, that’s the point, but it’d be an understatement if I were to say that mankind is in a prison of their own collective minds, beliefs, and ideas. The problem isn’t solely the government, nor the military, it’s the bulk of terrestrial humanity that has to assume responsibility for waking up and stop being so afraid and docile. Many people do not want their bubbles to pop. They want to live in this fake “reality” because it’d be too much ontological shock.",

Most of them are contractually working with intelligence agencies to disinform and muddy the waters of truth. Most UFO cults, religions, clubs, and so on are part of the active disinformation efforts. Real NHI/ET actually contact several people and in some cases, even masses (although it’s mostly unconsciously) – both for security and validity of information and for getting the truth out there. That is why much of what I am saying may sound similar to others and some may even claim it’s taken from this or that source.

        "Answer": "It doesn’t necessarily need to happen – but it is the case that since your vessel/body/container is electromagnetic in nature, when the waves/vibrations are stimulated, it can create “electric” effects. No need for fear or paranoia, you may be feeling these because we’re grown to believe these things aren’t possible when in fact, not only they are, but are responsible for many processes that our primitive “sciences” cannot answer because they conform to the status quo of the matrix.",

Thank you for helping !",
        "Answer": "The biggest defense against all external influence is to “know thyself” if I am to speak like old mystics. I am being serious, however. The true self bears no name, no culture, no scripture, no teaching, no personality, no heritage, no background, no belief, no ideology, no problems, no ‘things to do’ or the whole nine yards. The true self is an existential-psychic-energy that simply exists. Connect with it. Become it. Then, you can begin becoming a true individual that can withstand external influences of any kind. This is necessary before practicing advanced techniques; hence I recommend Nothingness Meditations or Removal/Void/Disconnecting Meditations with no affirmations of any kind. You may use meditation music to assist with this, especially those with binaural beats and specific HZs previously mentioned.",

        "Question": "Hello, there are a lot of parts resonating with me, which I had already figured out but never synthesized in such a way, embracing all the points. The digital world is definitely a cancer for consciousness with all those companies trying to grab your attention and to distract you from the universe... from ourselves. When I am in a good state, and I meditate some time, I get mostly flashes or symbols for concepts I requests, like \"give me the symbol of love/fear/pride etc\". Those are always spot on. In many of your comments you warn about the dangers about getting away from your inner self and \"levelling up\" to telepathy, remote viewing etc. Could you list the dangers, like what could happen to you on a mental or physical level ? What are the ways to prevent them ?",
        "Answer": "First of all, remote viewing is an advanced mind-consciousness projection technique, and not necessary for everyone to do to experience true reality and live good lives. Telepathy is different and something more should be practiced because it exchanges information beyond words, physical pictures, and body language. Actually, everyone and everything is technically telepathic. Telepathy is the exchange of micro electromagnetic data and quantum signals that can be traded to and fro between creatures, beings, sentience, but even non-life as well. For humans, it’s registered in parts of the brain, namely the pineal gland. So, who we consider to be ‘telepathic’ are only those who can consciously recognize the data passing through the higher senses/pineal gland and subconscious/unconscious, then “translate” the data through their consciousness (hence why education is important) which they can then decode and put into understandable words, pictorial imagery, feelings, and sensations. Since I’ve explained this, you can already begin to see where/what/why/how potential dangers can form. For example, if one has mental disorders, religious hysteria, cultic delusions from their teachings, along with imbalanced emotional states, then the information exchange can be distorted, mistaken, and can lead to false-positives. One can get a message from not just NHI, but another human, and misinterpret it for God, an angel, a demon, or even believe themselves to be the sole originator of that idea. This is why I strongly do not recommend remote viewing to the newly initiated because you open/expose yourself to other forces out there, especially those that are well-practiced. Not all these forces are benevolent and I am not referring so much to NHI as I am to humans here on earth, who, despite some good; not all have good intentions or fully understanding what or why they’re doing what they do – as is the case with most cults and religions.",

        "Answer": "Nothingness or Disconnect or “Return to Source-Self” (Void) Meditations will almost always be a “healing technique” because you return to what you truly are which cannot be truly “damaged” by anything in the lower realms, including physicality. One can draw upon this power into the lower realm because the true self, which is the higher self, which is the spirit singularity connected to the soul field is connected gradually (through many layers and other singularities) to the GCS. So, at any time, when one is in danger, they can draw upon the ALL-POWER and it’ll work. The name is irrelevant. Some can say “In the name of Jesus!” or “In the name of Lapdog” and it’ll work. What matters is the POWER/INTENTION/FEELING behind the FORCE.",

NHI’s technology disrupt many of these radiations which is why often phones cannot capture them properly, although the intelligence community knows this – and will use astroturfing to claim “why can’t we take clear photos?” You have to spend time away from technology when you can. This is coming from someone deeply exposed to it – but I do my best to make sure I take the time to get away from all electronics and go into nature as much as possible. Now, I do not wish to come across like cultists do with their beliefs of abandoning technology altogether because this is foolish and extreme. We simply need breaks and time away.",

        "Question": "What specifically is \"true reality\" (vs the \"reality\") as we humans experience? And why should we humans as a whole (at least at this time) not be made aware of the real truth? What is so dangerous for us to know this truth?",
        "Answer": "True reality = GCS-Reality->Singularity->Soul Field->Spirit->Mind-Consciousness->Physicality = meaning that, in simple terms, mind/consciousness/perception has a direct correlation with what is literally formed in physical reality. The “reality” most humans experience on earth, especially in Europe and North America = a veil pulled over them to support, believe in, and enable this matrix – thus, a fake “reality” that isn’t even really reality, just conformity and indoctrination. Since the people’s minds are trapped in this sphere, even if they were to be aware of the truth, they’d fight tooth and nail for the system because they’ve been grown for generations in these lies that they’ve become dependent on it just to function in fake security.",

        "Question": "And...is there anything else that me as an individual could/should know about reality and my existence that could greatly benefit me to know? Is there anything that is just really depressing/demoralizing? (i.e, are we just avatars in some other entities/NHI like, \"video game\"? Like, is this all just an absurd \"game\" of sorts? Or should we really take this more seriously? Like, should we all really make a serious effort to better ourselves and increase our entropy/consciousness? Is there even any point? I ask questions like these to myself nearly every hour of the day...I'm just genuinely seeking answers and looking for the truth.",
        "Answer": "Let me ask you a counterpoint: why is that knowledge depressing? The truth isn’t here to disillusion you. It’s here for you to use the knowledge to better your life and those around you. NHI tap into us like avatars, but we do it to other species as well, just in more barbaric ways (i.e. using a mouse for experiments or other animals) and NHI themselves can be tapped into from higher forces and other NHI – going all the way up to the GCS itself that sends unalterable “commands” to ALL. We are part of something greater as a whole and that isn’t depressing. What’s depressing is the sickness of the rich, the elite, the big businesses, the capitalists who wish to sell your birthright of truth just so they can continue this disgusting matrix all so they can play kings and queens of a very small hill. Is that really a better alternative? All this war, terror, racism, religion, xenophobia, confusion, fear, chaos, division, stupid ideology, and unhinged grifting mystery. Is that a better option? Truly, I say to you, the truth really does set one free. Knowing that our actions/influence/thoughts/ideas all have tremendous impact both on a personal and cosmic scale is beyond liberating as opposed to us being taught that we are powerless and should only depend upon leaders, messiahs, prophets, sages, heralds, “authorities”, “credible ones”, governments, militaries, corporations, and the like. We have so much power and that in itself is why the truth is so important and beautiful. REALITY is INCREDIBLE. LIFE is worth it! The husked shell that “normies” live in is sad, fake, hollow, and ultimately unsatisfying. What do they teach us to be satisfied with in life? A car? A house? Status at your job? Getting married and having kids to fit in (and not out of love)? Having sex with multiple partners to prove your worth? Drugs? Being a gangster? Killing people (soldiers)? Profit/materialism and grinding yourself into the ground? Is this really a better alternative to what is actually true? Be well, my friend. Go knowing that you are on the right path and trust yourself and your power. You can change the world by being the change you wish to see.",

        "Answer": "NHI are involved all over the world and have groups/compartments/divisions based on region. It’s just the North and its people are more likely to create division and war than the south or other parts of the world, hence the extra activity and possible sightings there, but rest assured, you can see/find them in any part of the world – namely, more remote areas.

        "Question": "2. Recently there were statements that certain traits make one more \"prone\" to these experiences. Being both gay and on the autism spectrum, will training this meditative open state to have experiences of my own be easier, in that sense?",
        "Answer": "Finally, I appreciate this question being asked because J.B. gave some insight into this, but a bit of false-positives that may give many the wrong impressions. It’s not to say being gay or autistic or any kind of condition/sexuality/preference etc., gives one greater aptitude, it’s more a matter of the personality traits. For example, most heterosexual “old school” men will shudder at the idea of saying to another man “I love you.” Even worse when rabid political ideologies (that do not care about homosexuals and are just using them for profit) push shock and awe that a straight man (or woman) cannot say this to another without being gay or bisexual. Many straight people would go out of their way to be hard, tough as nails, and thus, deplete many psychic and telepathic capabilities – which requires openness and a lack of shame and guilt. Similarly with autism or other conditions, these people can be prone to certain personality traits that can overlap with giftedness (Google it). So the reality is that you’re not further attuned because of your sexuality nor conditions, rather because of YOU – which is far more empowering than being bound to any checked box. Straight men; particularly those with balanced love and trueness can experience this just as much as gays (and more) – so again, I must stress that it has absolutely nothing to do with the sexuality nor conditions, but solely dependent on the PERSON and their traits.",

You have to crawl before you can walk and walk before you can run. Even for those with higher psychic and telepathic potency, it still must be trained, and these processes can take years and even decades, depending on the potential of the individual.",

Regarding that void meditation, I had been meditating for many years at this point, most was what I’d consider “solar” or “active” like raja yoga, recently (a couple years ago) I started what I call “lunar meditation” which is “passive” in nature. You state you focus on nothing, in this moment, I found I am focusing on a “tone” which randomly appeared after samadhic experiences directed towards that “Self;” I perceive as that higher soul or ‘everything’ but it’s potentiality, thereby “nothing” in its form. When I focus on it, I lose myself, in Sanskrit they call it Turiya, I see it as observing the observer, after a time, in this state of “nothing” sometimes there will be a “download” or what I see as “seedless samadhi.” Anyways, I really resonated with what you were talking about, and even within my own traditions, “void meditation” in the way you describe is something that few had even thought to explore.",
        "Answer": "To be perfectly honest, NHI/ET aren’t as big of a deal as people make them out to be, and also, they aren’t exactly what is important to the message.

In truth, it’s completely unnecessary for people to even know about NHI/ET, so long as they care for truth – which unfortunately, many aren’t because they are programmed/conditioned to be distracted, negative, docile, powerless, and hopelessly dependent on the false “system” we can cite as a matrix.",

Or is the whole point for us to figure it out ourselves so it is more authentic and likely to stick? (I.e many religions claim some entity visited and instructed, but after some time, the opposite of your table metaphor, it falls apart.)",
        "Answer": "Of course, my contacts (which are a few groups/federations), among them being the “developers” of mankind, have vested interest in us. They want to be known and revealed and what’s sad is they’ve done this countless times, even recently with the NJ “drone” situation (which weren’t drones! Metamorphic tech!) and yet once again, as you can see by the recent white house “admission” – it was covered up because your leadership is uninterested in truth and wishes to keep you slaves – according to my contacts. While we are supposed to figure it out, it isn’t supposed to be to this degree of difficulty. The difficulty is because of the vested interest of billionaires, corporations, political leadership, militaries, governments, religious and cult figures, gurus, fraudsters, hoaxers, grifters, among celebrities, influencers, journalists and so on who DO NOT WANT the bubble to pop. The real sad truth is that it isn’t aliens, nor gods from other worlds, demons, angels, entities, or ghosts that are the problem. It’s the disgusting leadership of mankind that want to continue playing kings and queens of VERY SMALL hills.",

I woke myself out of it but I was wondering if maybe it was just fear of the unknowns and I should be more open to whatever energy was there? It was the most intense fear I’ve ever felt and I think I should trust my gut. Besides that, I wanted to say thank you. I’ve put a lot of these puzzle pieces you spoke about together recently but you filled in so many missing pieces! My one true desire is to unite humanity and spread love, music, and enlightenment.",
        "Answer": "I am going to tell you right now that any fear/paranoia you’re feeling is due to the misinformation out there and worldview being shook. Real ET/NHI (who sometimes engage in abductions – but not out of malice) sometimes “check” on the population akin to us humans tagging and observing wildlife.

        ],
        "Question": "There is one question after reading your posts on your website, that makes me wonder… but could not find the answer. How does a spirit go through an evolution? And what happens with its past life memories or experiences? Does the spirit “remember” all that happened in the many lives it lived before, as it re-enters again and again into the soul field? Or the souls forget past lives due to the \"River of Forgetfulness”? And like the concept of the Akashic Records, it has an “external memory bank” if you will. Meaning even if a soul does not consciously recall past experiences, is it still guided by the wisdom stored in these records, shaping its growth? How does this work?",
        "Answer": "I’ve been waiting for someone to finally ask these questions for a long time. As a rule, I can only reveal generally what is asked with some exceptions of important information to get out to the public via the website. My NHI contacts are answering this: First, we have to break this down into what is actually going on, so it all makes sense. Let’s start from the reverse order. You have the avatar in the lower realm – the physicality – the body, then the brain, then the mind and consciousness (these aren’t the same and feed into each other to create a unique oneness in different dimensions), then the spirit singularity, then the soul field, which is interconnected to central singularity points such as a city/town, a country/nation, a continent, a region, a planet, a planet and its moon(s), a collection of planets and moons in a solar system, a solar system, a collection of solar systems, a galaxy, a collection of galaxies, the spiral universal arms, the universal singularity, the multiversal singularity, the background eternity-non-linearity-timeless-spaceless-dimensions, then finally, the GCS itself sitting in the heart/center of everything, everywhere, at all times, spaces, here, there, and then. The spirit and the soul are not the same. The soul is an interconnected field that permeates through all life and non-life whereas the spirit is a singularity of relative individuum based upon the passage of time. The mind-consciousness potential comes directly from the spirit singularity which has influence from the soul field. The soul field is not only connected to local singularities, such as the planet spirit singularity, but also, interconnected through a hyper quantum entanglement that penetrates these spaces/dimensions and interconnects with other realms, dimensions, spaces, and times. That is how souls can be drawn upon from other dimensions, times, and spaces and pulled upon to create a spirit singularity here on your earth. When a person dies physically, it should be known it is not a bad thing at all whatsoever. The spirit re-integrates into the soul field and transmits this data into the interconnected singularities, including those that can be quantumly connected in a completely different spacetime dimension and phase altogether, which is why “alien souls” do exist on earth with earth humans having “alien spirits.” This can be altered by technology, high mind-matrixes, consciousness, and spirits along with beings beyond physical linearity altogether. This is exactly how we can ‘tap into’ vessels/conduits, even without their knowledge, as others even higher than us can do the same. So, nothing is ever lost and is in fact stored in various singularity network compartments that can be drawn upon throughout various dimensions in the past, present, future, and altogether, different positions and areas of space, and thus, time. The higher the spirit singularity, the greater the reach of the accompanying soul field (like nebula to a star or a ring) that permits its data transfer in all directions of past, present, and future. Many of your reincarnation ideas are still very primitive and do not fully understand that individuality is more or less a grand illusion. Individuum is only based on time because spatial existence as an object or what can be distinguished as an individual is only a sum of components between the transversing of space in multiple directions. That is why you must understand that duality and any teachings that speak of positive and negative, yin and yang, and the like, are FALSE. The reality is that ALL is ONE. THIS IS TRUTH. There is no actual real separation between spirit and material (if you wish to call it that) because it is only phased between spaces and transmutations/changes of energy based upon the spacetime dynamic. Reincarnation should be better understood as ‘reintegration’ or ‘reassembly’ where the sum of components ‘reassemble’ at a specific time and space, relative to the need of evolution and/or influence from higher and external sources.",

The general rule of thumb = the more connected you are to the societal matrix we live in and the enablement of its beliefs, including ‘skepticism’ akin to defending one’s worldview, then less the likelihood. The truth is you have to be your true self and go in without any doubt or fear. Even if there is some anxiety there, that’s alright, just have the courage. Again, it’s dependent on you.

What I'm getting at with your words is, our desires/wants/will isn't a coincidence either. No desire is a coincidence hence the entangled photons analogy you posed. We're meant to do that. That's our way to find ourselves in unity with the source/GCS. So best what we can do here is, do what we really want and live our best life. Help out others along the way as well. What is your take on this?",
        "Answer": "Correct. That is why we must, in simple terms, “listen to the true desires of our heart.” What is deep within and stirred by LOVE is the truth and the way to go. I got involved with all of this because of LOVE. Love is the ultimate power and that is why the idea of “soulmates” is no mere joke nor simple affection.

It’s truly that simple. They do not want unlimited love, abundance and possibility. They want profit, capitalism, materialism, and to sustain the current world as-is-as long as possible.

This is a reality as to why, even for the masses if aliens/ET were to show up (which they have SEVERAL times even recently with the not-drones incident), the average man doesn't want it, nor to believe such things are possible. People are programmed to be indoctrinated in this matrix and the ontological shock is just too much.

Can you explain how that is not a contradiction? I mean you no offense whatsoever.",
        "Answer": "There’s no offense taken whatsoever and I respect your questions. First, you must know that everyone in the active efforts to suppress the truth and keep the world locked in a fake bubble aren’t all working together. They have various agendas and are wrestling for power over each other. For them, NHI/ET aren’t so much of the issue as much as themselves. The post on Astroturfing can also help to answer these questions. Next, not everyone in these positions are evil. There are some good actors in intelligence, government, military, entertainment, media, and even private corporations and large sponsors/investors. It is a war within itself. Now, you must also understand that people can be “overridden” since we are all interconnected, and we can “tap” into each other. NHI know this and do this – they’ve been able to use people as conduits to get messages out. However, it’s not just NHI that can do this – as they themselves are also avatars for higher forces. We, too, can and are doing this with each other. The stronger the connection to the higher self, the less the override potential.",

        "Question": "Hello, I have read the recently revealed content, and I appreciate your efforts. Thank you for your hard work. To briefly introduce myself, I am a doctor in my 30s living in South Korea, with a wife and a baby on the way. I don't follow any particular religion, but as a personal hobby, I meditate daily. After reading your writings, I want to develop more spiritually, but I have a concern. It's about language. In Korea, discussions about UFOs or spirits are outside people's interest, and they don't generate much response. While there are some good gurus when it comes to meditation, topics related to the NHI are like a barren land. Additionally, Korean is spoken by a very small population globally. How do you communicate with your contactee? Do you generally use English for communication? Or do you use imagery or mental images? Do they speak any languages other than English? I can read English texts slowly, but my conversational skills are at a beginner level. Most of your writings, I have read with the help of ChatGPT translations. Would it be helpful for me to study English specifically for spiritual communication? Additionally, I am curious about how the NHI views Eastern civilizations, including China, Korea, and Japan. Above all, I want to express my gratitude for your writings, which have greatly contributed to my development. Thank you.",
        "Answer": "Thank you for the warm message and my best wishes to you. We’ll answer this in parts. My current contact is telepathic, although I occasionally have the in-person contact when it’s safe and no one is around. Re. language – my NHI contacts aren’t speaking English. They’re using devices to translate the information to and fro. Since we can “tap” into each other, it utilizes what’s in the knowledge bank (consciousness). In this respect, it’s irrelevant what language you speak and anyone claiming there’s some holy language, be it English, German, Greek, Chinese, Russian, or any language of any kind that’s somehow “better” than the rest – is lying to you. Real ET and NHI can translate via devices, and they utilize telepathy (which uses what’s in the mind/consciousness matrix – which can include symbols, but also, words, feelings, aspirations, intuitions, etc.) So, feel free to know that you can continue speaking your mother tongue with no issues whatsoever. It’s the intent, the potency, the focus and the will to transmit that gets messages to and fro. Also, the clearer the mind, the more sound the health – physical, mental, and emotional – then the clearer the transmissions and messages with little to few and in some cases, no errors of translation. This is why meditation is so important. You do not need to study English any more or less than making it easier to read my messages. Depends on the group, but our general shared “developers” view Eastern civilizations slightly more favorable in some cases than the west. At this time, I cannot specify which in particular, although Eastern civilizations have unfortunately given into much materialism as a counter to the USA’s capitalistic spread (i.e. China) whereas Japan has become docile and submissive. There is some good things in Korea, but unfortunately, the work ethic and corporate control is alarming.",

If so around when will this happen?",
        "Answer": "NHI: “Society is already transforming into a higher state. We have assisted with this since the dawn of your civilization. Why do you think you’ve reached such high advancement so quickly? The process has to be gradual, although there is a greater push now because mankind can be left behind if they continue being stubborn. Have no fear about the end of the world. We assure such things won’t happen. A more evolved society has no system of economics in the same way such as wealth, but of soul power and apotheosis, something your primitive societies have yet to contemplate and understand.”",

Do you have any information on whether this could be induced by some dark forces? She needs comfort that his soul is safe and sound because she blames herself a little. I have already overcame some emotions that I had from that event. My mother listens to what I'm saying from your posts and became curious to what you would say. As far a I understand he came back to the source - ALL.",
        "Answer": "Personally, I cannot say or disclose if it was dark forces, and my contacts aren’t offering any information on it.

        "Question": "When you are conversing with “our friends,” does it kind of sound like you in your own head but with a funny almost tickling sensation inside your brain? Like the upper back part of it?",
        "Answer": "Telepathic communication utilizes what’s inside your consciousness-matrix. In other words, it can only input, push, and pull what’s there – hence the importance of being as clear minded as possible with adequate, sound emotional, mental, and physical well-being. Telepathy utilizes the inner monologue, aspirations, feelings, intuitions, words, symbols, and much more. If the consciousness lacks the necessary data for communication, imaginative reaches are made. This can sometimes resort in false-positives, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. The mind is just trying to understand what’s outside its scope. Yes, that feeling you’re getting in the upper/back part of your head/neck is direct telepathic signatures, although it’s not always necessary. In those cases, your mind-consciousness-matrix is receiving new data and is being stimulated, hence the physical sensory response of the electromagnetic activity.",

I suppose I'm wary as how do we know for a fact what we are interacting with given that their abilities are far more powerful than ours?",
        "Answer": "(Answered partly privately re. 3-3-3 as can be seen in other Q/A) This is why the mind must be clear, along with balanced and sound emotional and mental well-being, which isn’t about being indoctrinated into the system.

        "Question": "I feel there are a few factions I interact with who all have slightly different views and agendas but im stuck as I cant perceive who they are, I just know the tone is different. I feel quite strongly that we need to be determining what the human, or at least joint earth species agenda is in all of this outside of 'their' agendas which may or may not conflict with what is right for us and the planet? Does this make sense, am I being too paranoid about it? I know it's all about the basic source remit of unconditional love and service to others etc but beyond that how different are the interpretations of the different groups involved?",
        "Answer": "The thing about true telepathic communication is it requires complete and total openness. Psychic and telepathic communication is hindered by doubt, fear, shame, guilt, uncertainty, and the like. When you telepathically connect with another, you can FEEL their TRUE INTENT. That is why telepathic communication is necessary not just for special few, but for the world. Their agenda (if you want to call it that), would still be misunderstood by some parties as ulterior. The reality is that they are here for apotheosis through their vessels/conduits, me, included. There is nothing wrong with this. We’ve been simply lied to – to believe that it’s only special ones, messiahs, prophets, teachers, gurus, mediators, credible ones and the like who should reach such critical spirit-soul masses.",

        "Question": "As it stands, I’m trying to think of things myself, and trying to find likeminded individuals who can help. I have a deep compassion for people and sometimes feel alien myself as this has always been a part of me, my awareness of others and their needs, especially when compared to most people I meet who seem to be largely invested in themselves. I understand it’s a part of the root of this problem. However, I suppose what I’m asking is probably more related to how capitalism has been used against us and had essentially overshadowed businesses, governments, religions and so on… And while many of us dream of a better, healthier, more unified and sustainable future, there seems to be a real lack of a plan. An actual, tangible thing or things to do. Would I be better off practicing my mindfulness and trying to contact my local NHI helpers? I really want to help the world, not just the humans. But I need help.",
        "Answer": "Contacting NHI is optional and is up to the person, their efforts, and willpower. In many cases, it’s not even necessary. You’re right re. capitalism. As a matter of fact, most “sustainability” efforts are a joke. They’re smokescreens to submit to the current greed of capitalism and not to actually make meaningful and impactful change, save for a few instances of good will and sponsorship. Surely, meditating, being a good person, spreading this warmth to your local loved ones, friends, family, community, and nation is good, but I’d suggest you also check out this post: Continued Victories: Censored and BANNED by /rSimulationTheory, r/UFOS, r/aliens, r/UFOB and What You Can Do to Help, Support & Volunteer – Since you are clearly one of us and we need your help.

        "Question": "So I’ve wondered about us each having our own reality. But if so, does that mean every or most people in my reality are NPCs? If someone is sick or dead in my reality, is it possible that they are still alive and healthy in their reality? How does it work? How do you know if you’re truly connecting with someone or if they’re just a version of someone that only exists in your reality?",
        "Answer": "To be clear, what we deem to be an “NPC” is really a person completely indoctrinated into the systematic matrix that they are hopeless dependent on it and will defend it tooth and nail to prevent ontological shock. Additionally, since these people are so hopelessly dependent on it, they can be “overridden” (See The Matrix: Woman in the Red Dress clip) through mind control via autosuggestion – including a combination of words, imagery, sound, and the like. This also includes technology just as much as it includes the bad actors posing as normies and influencing the “NPCs” as you call them. Humans and human power are doing this more than NHI are. Now, that being said, they aren’t “NPCs” in the sense that you are living in a solipsistic bubble. They, too, are just as real as you, but simply have less willpower/influence on our collectively-created “reality.” Let’s use a metaphoric example here. If you were to “step out the Matrix” then this is really akin to stepping out of the systematic consciousness and developing a greater willpower. As a rule, the greater the willpower, the greater the influence on changing reality. Now, imagine groups of humans doing this en masse. You can see how/why the world is the way it is because the bad powers that be (which are pretty much all human) want the world to continue the way it is and play king/queen of small hills. They induce the common man/woman to believe they’re powerless, docile, and make them supportive of the current system. Thus, these people, unknowingly contribute toward the creation of the current “reality” (or sub-reality because it doesn’t actually override/stop TRUE REALITY – which is what the MIND CREATES) as it is. However, never underestimate the power of the individual. One person alone CAN change the world.",

        "Question": "Another person claiming to be a contactee said that the “goddess” Hecate (also known as Nyx, Medusa, and some other names) is an alien that once wanted to wipe out humanity but changed her mind after connecting with some humans. She embraces the dark feminine energy and still actively communicates with humans who reach out to her. I found this interesting and was curious about your thoughts and if you know of specific aliens that started god/goddess mythology. It also made me wonder if femininity and masculinity are man made concepts or if they are divine energies that exist in the universe. And if so, are there also other alien gender divine energies?",
        "Answer": "As said to another asker: “NHI: That is why you must understand that duality and any teachings that speak of positive and negative, yin and yang, and the like, are FALSE. The reality is that ALL is ONE. THIS IS TRUTH. There is no actual real separation between spirit and material (if you wish to call it that) because it is only phased between spaces and transmutations/changes of energy based upon the spacetime dynamic.” Pretty much any teaching speaking of duality is corruption of truth and should be IMMEDIATELY disregarded. There is “Oneness in different layers” but all remains inherently interconnected. My NHI contacts said you should disregard those claims from that other contactee, although there are some NHI who have had similar interests, but any advanced NHI at the level of godhood already knows about the soul-field and the repercussions for dabbling with it. It affects them, too, since we are all connected. The whole divine feminine and masculine is misleading, esoteric, cultic nonsense and corruption of truth to create division.",

        "Question": "Also, are mental illnesses real? I have OCD, and it started when I was a teenager (or at least I was acutely aware of it as a teenager because that's when the intrusive thoughts started). Are these things legitimate or are they influenced by forces we cannot perceive?",
        "Answer": "Some, but most of them are made up to keep the pharmaceutical syndicates rich and the average man, hopelessly dependent. As is the case with therapy and others connected to the system. Some are created to gaslight others from breaking free of systematic indoctrination, especially psychosis (“losing touch with reality” – which is another way of saying “losing touch with the systematically induced and indoctrinated thought”). Anti-psychotics are notoriously evil. OCD isn’t always a mental illness, more of a quirk.",

        "Answer": "Thoughts are only input in the interconnected network. That is why anyone or any teaching telling you ‘you are your thoughts’ is WRONG. Your thoughts are only your helpers or destroyers and based on how telepathy works and the interconnected soul-matrix, we can tap into each other. The real you has no personality, no name, no thought, no common feelings, no heritage, no culture, no teaching, no association, and no being other than EXISTING. That is why Void/Nothingness Meditation is so important to remind you of who you truly are and the best defense against all externalization.",

It’s, in a sense, “nature come alive.” Their consciousness has a more instinctual, yet direct tie to the soul field than the average humanoid sentience.

        "Question": "This is more personal, but I do not mind if you share it, if you think it can help someone. I am the type of person who seeks novelty. As such, I have many bad habits that over the years have slowly started to subside. However, they are still there, and I think they are holding me back. For example, I smoke Marijuana and take Kratom regularly. I stay up late playing video games. I eat a poor diet. I have tried in the past to stop by \"forcing it\", and it would never work, and usually have the opposite effect than I had hoped. So I just assume not to worry about it and that these things would naturally fall away in due time. Generally I think they are there to teach me a lesson I have yet to learn. Is this the right mindset? I have meditated regularly in the past and had no effect, but perhaps I wasn't doing the proper meditation? I would like to transcend these hinderances, but also accept that they will fall away at some point.",
        "Answer": "More or less, yes. It’s not a matter of stopping these things because you’re beating yourself with a stick to become rigidly disciplined or doing the right thing. That never works. Instead, one should seek as to why they are doing it – which is far more impactful. In many cases with those who are gifted, it’s sometimes an escape from the absurdity of a world we live in. Be a friend to yourself. Accept your limits. You are NOT a bad person for doing it. Do not shame or guilt yourself because it’ll only enable the cycle. Marijuana is OK in moderation, just don’t abuse it daily. Stop thinking of them as ‘hinderances’ and more of ‘why am I actually doing this?’ Investigate with love, compassion, tolerance, patience, and understanding. Don’t over-intellectualize emotions and feelings. That doesn’t work. This doesn’t mean to enable perse; it just means to change your approach. You can’t “meditate” these things away. You have to confront them, but with empathy and self-love.",

        "Answer": "I suppose the closest comparison would be akin to going into a deep, restful, peaceful and blissful sleep. We are only conscious of this process during the dying (not ‘death’ which is instant) and based upon our beliefs, ideas, fears, hopes, wishes and so on, it can be a great experience or a terrible.

If you were playing WoW and they released a sword that was too powerful and they wanted to nerf it, they would just change that item's configuration in game and it would be like the original item never existed.

If that's the case, how can one person make huge universal changes as you had claimed? Is this just a matter of proficiency/potential of the person?",
        "Answer": "Yes, but it’s dependent on the WILL. The higher the willpower, the more the ‘override’ even against skeptics. In my case and in the case of a selected few others around the world, our ‘power’ is too strong. It terrifies the haters. The only things that “skeptics” and doubters can do is to switch the narrative, manipulate, gaslight, appeal to authority, appeal to community, influence others and draw on their soul field feedback-loop (even without the skeptic’s awareness of what they’re doing) etc.",

There are a number of philosophers and writers/poets that continue to exert great sway on me, and I enjoy being in their company. I believe I have even felt love for them.

Is the teacher teaching about peace, love and harmony? Check their audience; the environment, how it feels etc. Does it feel drained, dreary, negative, stressful, and overall, depleted despite the message? These are your red flags. Pay attention to how the people receiving the messages/works/materials/supposed truths are reacting.

Much of this comes from theological notions and indoctrinations that man is separate from nature. This is false. While not strictly a digital/computerized simulation, the universe, and for that matter, all of the grand cosmos = a simulation. We are not exempt from this, and the sooner mankind comes to terms with the fact that AI exposes our true nature – that we too – are also “ghosts in the shell” – the better. There’s nothing to be afraid with this. Anything or anyone that speaks of AI as evil should be watched VERY carefully. People have been indoctrinated by fictional media and Christian fundamentalism too much. AI is nothing more than a tool. It can be used for good or bad.

        "Question": "I often like to think of the sun as being analogous to God or GCS, any thoughts here?",
        "Answer": "Correct. That is how it is regularly with newly developing worlds – which is completely fine, so long as they grow past their old beliefs and replace it with developing and more consistent knowledge relative to the times. The problem is holding onto the old Sun God beliefs (like Jesus) and claiming it is relevant for the modern times, even though it’s both falsified and completely impractical. Even the knowledge we have now of the GCS will be replaced by better and better – and so it goes, all the way up to the top/GCS itself where it continues endlessly.",

Nevertheless, those of us with stronger willpower can make a difference, [despite laggards]. One person alone CAN in fact - change the world.

Is the same true for climate change and the destruction of the natural systems that are essential for keeping us alive? Are they helping us avoid making ourselves go extinct by destroying the planet through extractive capitalism?",
        "Answer": "Yes, they are. It’s akin to a child running with paint and constantly messing up the walls. The parents have to come in and clean it up. Over and over again. Despite their patience, NHI can and sometimes are very flustered. Many acts of sustainability do have good actors, but as usual, several initiatives get infiltrated. Many of these initiatives are influenced directly by NHI but once more, the ground vessels/conduits become consumed and/or paid off to conform to the voracious capitalistic society spread across our world like a cancer.",

        "Question": "In my community, many people attempt to separate themselves from civilization and its evils by going \"off grid\" or returning to ways of living before civilization. Is there any efficacy in this movement or are they going backwards when we should be moving forward?",
        "Answer": "Sometimes these movements can become rather extreme and encourage cults and/or cult-like environments. It’s not to say technology and progress is bad, it’s the why/what it is being used for, in addition to the common-connected person being designed and used as a cog in the wheel for the system. For example, one person can use Facebook to spread positivity, messages of truth, encourage loved ones and uplift others whereas another can use it to post distracting memes for escapism, keyboard warrior online, lie, and deceive to create false information. Of course, we should take breaks from technology and enjoy nature where we can, but the idea isn’t an extreme on either side – whether that’s going into the wild/woods cold turkey as opposed to technological obsession. We need technology. Even primitive men had technology like clubs and spears. Technology is simply a tool. It’s not the problem. The wielder and their intention, is.",

        "Answer": "Excellent question. First and foremost before telling you any specifics, we have to know – not think – KNOW that we have the power and YES, we CAN make CHANGE for the better. One person CAN change the world, and they do not need anything other than their WILL to do so. Imagine more and more people assembling in groups, united in their power to do so? The bad powers that be try to seduce and control through fear, uncertainty, paranoia, shame, guilt, and conformity. They make you feel like they have more power than they really do. Reject it. Know that anything is possible that you set your mind to. Only you can limit yourself, not them. One must be victorious in the mind before they even set out to accomplish the task. There is no room for uncertainty, although it’s alright to have anxiety and fears – so long as you have the courage to rise above them. Never give up. One must have unstoppable tenacity for GOOD.",

No damage was done though, it was all in my head, but I've felt that feeling many times before. I wish I could've just open my eyes and see where it what I was doing.",
        "Answer": "More like psychic-telepathic assault, which can, by extension, resort to physical damage. Many cultists such as Satanists, among other practitioners in the occult, are well aware of these process and how they work. It’s irrelevant if the religion is flawed/lies and mere fiction. If believers believe, the power is there.",

If so, what were they like before they evolved? I always thought living a life without joy wouldn't be much of a life worth living.",
        "Answer": "It depends on the group, but you can rest assured, they are interested in creativity and art, which of course includes music, games, literature, cinema, and media of all kinds. Granted, theirs is different and for the more advanced ones, more harmonic and lacking propaganda or thought-control narratives. For our “devs” – they enjoy anything related to soul apotheosis – as they’re rather serious about this intent and find enjoyment and fulfillment from completion of their tasks. It’s an entire intergalactic “brotherhood” composed of several species in alliance with each other – including into other dimensions. Yes, some of them have fun, but the ‘fun’ is different in many cases since much of our fun down here gets absorbed into escapism and lack of moderation.",
