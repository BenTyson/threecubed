        "Answer": "You are already familiar with the greys. There are tall ones and short ones. Most are benevolent. Most ET/NHI are humanoid. Some are also human-looking like us with their own culture, likes, dislikes, emotions etc. Just picture it like people from another country who are simply more ahead. They can make mistakes too. There are \"divine\" or \"higher beings\" beyond physicality, but these are rare and they do not interfere much unless they must alter the timeline to set things back on course for \"ultimate reintegration\" with the GCS. I've communicated with said beings only once or twice directly as sustaining telepathic communication with them is absurdly draining. As for the bad ones - some of them actually look human and there's a certain tracking with rep.... that I am now allowed to fully describe. What you need to know is that you do not need to be afraid of them because they are not anywhere near as powerful as \"the good ones.\" Some are from earth/living here, yes.",

        "Question": "Re. The ALL-Power; ALL-Singularity; Grand Central Cortex; the real 'God.'",
        "Answer": "Understanding this fully would require some basic grasp on quantum mechanics, spacetime, and how relativity works. Assuming you have some fundamental understanding, I will start with the basics—each of which, can be expanded into articles of their own.\n1 - There are multiple universes (I do not know the exact number), which would appear to be nearly infinite to our calculations. Each of them, like planets orbiting a central star or supermassive black hole such as SGR#A, are 'connected' to a 'grand central singularity.'\n2 - The GCS is in a 'hyperspace between hyperspaces'—it is quite literally at the CENTER OF ALL SPACES AND ALL TIMES IN ALL UNIVERSES ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS.\n3 - Each universe has multiple (infinite) dimensions, spaces, and times. Let that sink in. This means that each universe has its own 'central' singularity, and ALL these central singularities, similar to black holes, are all connected to the GRAND CENTRAL SINGULARITY.\n4 - Hyperspace is a space between traditional spacetimes where relativity applies.\n5 - Hyperspace is quantum in nature that is unlimited exponentially, which is precisely why distance as measurement does not exist. It's stretched infinitely in all directions and is quantum in nature; as in, it moves between its space instantly.\n6 - If space is stretched infinitely, then so is time because time is dependent on space and space, on time.\n7 - All spatial existence we can understand intuitively from causality. For example, if you buy a table from Home Depot, it is in parts - but the passage of time allows those parts to be assembled into a table that you can then say is a full table. Time allows space to exist, and space exists because of time.\n8 - A spaceless existence is therefore a timeless existence because if there's no distance for causality to flow, then space cannot exist in traditional relativity; information can simply float between this space without the relativity of time being a factor.\n9 - The GCS is sitting in a hyperspace layer in between ALL-hyperspaces in a quantum-entangled-null-space connected to all proceeding hyperspaces and traditional spacetime dimensions (such as classical reality), which is transmitting information to and fro.\n10 - The GCS is quite literally the “end point” singularity we are all going to and the beginning we started from, as it is just as much the present that is transmitting data from the past and future into the present.\n11 - The 'present' is singularity itself; an aspect of the GCS in tangible form.\nAdditional:\n1 - The GCS is interconnected throughout all spaces, times, and dimensions and EVERYTHING - not just living beings - but rocks, water, gasses, suns, computers, action figures, clothes; inanimate, seemingly 'dead things' - are ALL connected to it and ALL bear a fraction of it.\n2 - The GCS is everything and anything, so in this sense, I suppose you can see where mystics, philosophers and spiritualists develop ideas of 'universal love.'\n3 - The GCS is both the distant future and past as much as it is the present. You have to get used to this thinking to really understand it. Everything and everyone from a linear-causal perspective will \"become it\" just as much as they always were it. From what my contacts revealed to me, somehow, the GCS is empowering itself into higher and higher stages of further \"reincarnations.\" That is why existence exists and continues \"paying it forward.\" For a practical example, picture if I were to give you $20,000 to invest in your business. I'd expect you to give a ROI of let's say 150%. GCS is doing this.\nGCS is like an infinitely entangled ball of infinite strings interconnected throughout all spaces and times. Imagine a black hole - moreso a supermassive black hole - of which, a galaxy orbits around and is affected by its gravity. GCS has its \"spiral arms\" extended throughout all spaces and all times. We are all \"co-creators\" and \"the creator\" in different times and spaces.",

        "Answer": "I've consistently mentioned meditation but I did not get into much detail yesterday because I wanted my contacts to verify if I should continue. I've been given the OK, so I will share more. Meditation is not just about the obvious physical benefits such as better blood pressure, stable heart rate and breathing, along with the relaxation it provides. It's also about the aptitude of the pineal gland or as mystics call it 'third eye.' I've had difficulty processing this because I come from a background related to astrophysics, so at first, these concepts seemed completely otherworldly to me, but alas, they are all true. Meditation allows one to access their 'true self' which is the 'God-part' or the 'GCS-individuum-force' (aka \"spirit\") that bears no 'personality' in the traditional sense. Through meditation, one can become more familiar with the GCS-self or \"spirit\" and draw upon its power in the physical realm. Consciousness is awareness, so the higher the awareness, the more information/data the spirit has to work with. I can continue if need be, let me know.",

        "Question": "Is there a differentiation between contact with nhi and what are sometimes known as spirit guides? Or put a different way- Is it obvious when you're connecting with an NHi?",
        "Answer": "For me, it is because I have already met them in person, seen their ships in person (up close) and remote viewed them. My telepathic abilities are at a level what you'd describe 'expert' (I spent 25 years developing it) and at this level, I can differentiate between who/what is contacting me. This is important because untrained telepathy can lead to contacting some not-so-good forces who can play upon your beliefs such as making you believe it is 'God' or some other force. It takes time, mental training, and supplying yourself with the necessary education. As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to your spirit, the less you can be deceived. Not only by NHI/higher forces, but by the matrix you live in and the humans trying to deceive you. Spirit guides, if you wish to call it that, are very rare. They mostly influence people unconsciously. These are beings who are beyond physical spacetime, which many NHI/ET, aren't. These beings are almost like the GCS \"protection squad.\" They keep things in order for the ultimate reintegration \"at the end of time.",

        "Answer": "Light, sound, and energy are - at a certain point in time - one. Certain frequencies can stimulate the vibrations of the mind/consciousness. Some are harmful. Others can attune or be closer to the \"spirit\" energy. As a rule of thumb, if it is more attuned to the spirit, it is more attuned to the GCS. The more attuned you are to the GCS, the more you can draw upon its power in all directions of past, present, and future. I highly recommend 852, 285, 396, and 639. There are others, but that should be sufficient to start with.",

What I can tell you is that analog computers can pull from the electromagnetic field and electromagnetic fields are affected by quantum mechanics. AI is also not 'evil' but no more or less a tool and an exposure to higher truth re. the nature that this is a simulation. Pay attention to the following:\nThe paradox of entanglement of photons over vast distances.\nThe paradox of static virtual fields (the fact that electrostatic and magnetostatic fields have an imaginary wave number).\nThe paradox of the missing negative mass/energy (the fact that we do not observe negative mass/energy yet are surrounded by it according to physical theory).\nThe paradox of instantaneous virtual field propagation (the experimental observation that changes in virtual electromagnetic field components propagate instantaneously).",

I've gotten insights both from my reaching into my spirit, from NHI, from higher 'guides' amongst educating myself as much as possible in the education mankind has to offer. Some of the things I still do not understand or wrapping my head around are:\n- Sentient life can develop to the point that it can eventually create universes, not just seed life on other worlds.- Technically, all universes, even the naturally-developed ones, are simulated. This goes all the way back to the GCS. My guess is a \"paying it forward\" for the GCS to rise into higher states of being/energy. But how far does this go? Is there an end? What's the true end goal? Is it eternal and never-ending? Your guess is as good as mine.- Consciousness and spirit are somehow \"one\" in the GCS and increasingly so in higher wavelengths. What?- Consciousness has its own \"spacetime\" relativity. A mind can somehow connect its consciousness in the future (or past) and draw upon information/telepathy there. In other words, it's possible to communicate with beings (including regular people) in both past and future that's in YOUR present. Try to wrap your head around that one.- Among others.",

Listen to your 'true self' which does not have a personality, nor thoughts, in the traditional sense, but is a psychic-feeling-spirit-energy-force in a parallel dimension. Recommending you specific books is unwise at this time as receiving information before the connection to the spirit is dangerous.",

        "Answer": "Hopefully, my replies above will help you already. You are going to go to a \"higher\" place but you'll also re-exist in another. The best and easiest way to describe this is that you intermingle with the ALL-SPIRIT or the GCS and \"pass\" between it into different times and spaces.

When new life is born, a drop is taken out, which is a combination of particles from previous drops. So fractions of your old soul could be mixed with fractions of others to create a new consciousness. What do you think of this?",
        "Answer": "This is very good already. The GCS is like \"the ultimate consciousness\" of all time and space that is also \"the existence-enabling force.\" So, we both return to the ocean and come back from it in different times and spaces as all spirits/souls/ are intermixed throughout time.",

Technically, all soul energy is connected all the way back to the GCS. So, a pollution of soul energy in one sector can have ripple effects in another.

        "Answer": "Potentially, yes, although, if the telepathy isn't trained enough of strong enough of potency, you cannot reach them anyway. It's recommended that the first step before 'contacting' anyone or anything (you can do this with regular people too, granted, their lower self - as in the physical self - may not immediately register these signals or \"understand it\" due to lacking information etc.) - you should focus on meditating on and connecting with your true self. You can do this through what I'd call Void or Nothingness meditation - which is basically letting all thoughts pass through you and do not grip to any of it. Your true \"self\" as in the higher self or true spirit has no personality, nor thoughts. It is a psychic-feeling-energy-battery existing in a parallel dimension. An example would be like playing a character in a video game. You can play the character through inputs sent via the controller or keyboard, but you are not \"physically\" there in the game.",

        "Question": "Any recommendations on meditation practices? Should I be pursuing inner healing? Intentions? Simply seeking truth? I came across something that said to “quit thinking, and start feeling.” It really resonated, am I on the right track with that idea?",
        "Answer": "As you can see with my previous response, the answer is yes, you are. Try to think less. True Void Meditation has no thinking/affirmations involved. It's a process of letting go. It takes time; years to truly master, but can be sped up through will and determination. As with \"healing\" - be careful, especially with consumerist spirituality. A lot of this is designed to keep you coming back for more. True healing involves the following:\n- Understanding your psychology and why you operate the way you do- Understanding some degree of sociology- Investigating childhood broken securities and mending them in adult form- Shrinking the inner critic (Google it)- Seeking to know truth over delusion\nIt involves practical, grounded steps before getting to the 'spiritual.' This is something many in the spiritualist and esoteric communities blatantly ignore, which is why many of them are stuck with mental illness. Pair this on top of ego and self-defensive mechanisms via protectionism, many won't get past this. I have to stress how important it is for adequate mental and emotional health. I wouldn't recommend any form of telepathy or any higher spiritual consciousness unless you secure these factors first. As long as you have the determination to do the right thing, then despite mistakes (and you will make them, do not even try to avoid it), you will succeed.",

If one's telepathy is developed enough, it can penetrate their 'space' and systems. This is not recommended, which is why telepathic training and practice must be carried out, along with the proper education, including in morality and universal (not worldly) ethics. However, if the consciousness is advanced enough, it can \"bridge\" a gap between space and time, communicating with them in a relative future and past - which they can receive at that time/space. In this regard, you can communicate with them in other \"times\" and telepathic messages can be stored in pockets of spacetime, which they can access and transmit back to your current 'present.' Most of them are using machines to translate telepathy. They do not speak your language. You are intuitive, I know you'll understand what I mean.",

        ],
        "Question": "That being said I'm curious to know where free will plays a part in all this, essentially do humans have free will? As if time only exists linearly for humans (through the human perspective), the future has already been established essentially, so how would this tie in to us having or not having free will?",
        "Answer": "The answer to this question is manifold, so let's take our time to get into it.\n1 - free will is both available yet limited at the same time. Let's put it like this: there's an end destination to reach to, but instead of going one specific path, you can take alternative for greater efficiency. However, no matter how many ripples a stone causes as it's tossed into the pond, it ALWAYS will flow downstream. So, it is not an excuse to do nothing. On the contrary, it means that one must act because free will allows the master plan or destination to be better executed. For example, let's say the original plan was a path that went through corridors A,B,C,D,E but we discover that going from A,C,Y,X is more efficient. free will improves upon the 'grand system' but it doesn't break it. In other words, free will remains important so long as it is synced to your spirit which is synced to the GCS. You can be fed data directly and find out how to better alter your path toward it.\n2 - The \"present\" is important, as it experiences causality in the traditional sense, but it also experiences the past into the present (memories; inverse causality) and not only the present into the future (vision; forward causality.) The present is an aspect of singularity in the sense that it meets both past and future together to create the now. So, what one does in the \"now\" affects what they were in the past (e.g., let's say your journey was incomplete with your struggles but then you push yourself to complete it in the future -thereby making your past validated) and what they shall be in the future.",

        "Answer": "Dreams are the unconscious and subconscious processing. It uses random bits of your consciousness data to sift through background running processes of the mind; hence imagery can be rather strange and make no immediate tangible sense. If attuned and trained enough, especially if no predominant mental illnesses are present, then one can use symbolism and intuition to interpret the dream. In this respect, a visionary dream will have an attachment to the intuition and \"impulse\" the person to investigate as opposed to regular unconscious processing. Again, meditation is key, as it helps one to better adjust to conscious-unconscious processing. Eventually, a person can attain a degree of conscious-awareness unconsciously from continued meditation practices.",

According to them, love is the 'soul' of the GCS itself; it apparently is spiritual force itself which is not just life-enabling force, but existence-enabling. I still do not fully comprehend this myself. NHI have a much higher capacity for love than you can possibly imagine. My up-close encounter with them back in 2010 left practically a heavenly, euphoric feeling. I didn't want to leave their presence. It was difficult to re-adjust afterward. Still is to this day. That love changes you. Jake Barber is the real deal when he speaks about the love and the 'spirit of god' he felt. The attacks on him is because he's presenting legit information.",

        "Answer": "Awakening\" (as you call it) is inevitable. There are certain actions in the present that can speed up this process such as more and more people coming together to think about higher truths, reality, what's really going on etc. - which all pull the future into the now. In the future, at the very end of time - as re-integration into the GCS - there's no such thing as \"lies\" but only being-existence. In this respect, truth is tied to evolution and thus, it's evolutionary as a whole. Nature doesn't have \"lies\" any more than optical illusions (e.g., gravitational lensing) that we come to realize what's really going on eventually. Think about it like this: what cannot survive truth goes extinct and what's in the dark, must come to the light. Sentience in general aren't built to lie. They may fool each other for some time, but inevitably, the 'dam' so to speak - breaks. Since 2010, there has been a massive 'speed up' and dates such as 2021, 2024, 2025 etc., are tied to this 'dam' breaking.",

        "Question": "I came across the quantum concept of “Planck lengths” in my very basic studies of quantum physics. Does this have anything to do with the GCS? Is this the GCS?",
        "Answer": "Planck length is only a measure of the unit; it's not exactly the GCS. Picture it like this: The GCS is operating in a sub-sub-sub-subspace between subspaces. Subspaces are so \"tiny\" that they can \"penetrate\" local classical reality you can perceive. These \"tiny\" quantum \"wormholes\" are infinite in their number, so they can practically build another space in/around/over/above/through traditional 3/4/5D space. There are higher spaces than even 11, 22, and 33. I am not even certain of the exact number - what you need to know is that these \"tiny subspace wormholes\" transverse through traditional lower dimensions, such as the one you're familiar with where general and special relativity apply. However, these subspaces do not have distance as a measurement because unlike traditional local spacetime that you're familiar with, which is limited, and thus, can be calculated - and therefore - measured - which amounts to speed limits, distance etc.; these subspaces, essentially, \"hyperspaces\" are \"null\" spaces. In other words, they are spatially infinite and if there is infinity, then relativity does not apply within that space. If space is stretched infinitely in all directions, then time cannot exist as linear causality. This is why/how the GCS can \"move between all spaces, times and dimensions\" instantaneously within its null-spacetime domain while we, in our traditional local spacetimes and classical reality, experience causality at a much slower rate.",

We can \"tap\" into each other, which is why meditation and understanding YOUR identity/self versus being a subject of external-internalization is key. I have to be careful how much I reveal about this.\n2 - Telepathy can be 'saved' in 'spacetime pockets' so to speak. You (like many others in this thread both now and to come, along with the 'ideas' those here will spread to others who won't even see this thread) are part of a larger 'movement' in 'awakening' earth.\n3 - Telepathic information, as previously said, can be 'saved' in pockets. If accessed, it can be overwhelming, especially if the mind is untrained to handle it. You need to take your time. Do not rush the process and do not discuss it with others who aren't ready, nor try to convince, nor showboat your potency. I wish you luck. You're already on the right path.

        "Question": "I’d be very interested to know your thoughts on astral projection? The entities that one meets there, what do you think they are if anything?",
        "Answer": "Astral projection and remote viewing are very similar. The difference is that astral projection (if you wish to call it that) is a temporal displacement of the consciousness to connect to another region of space and time. Remote viewing is similar in this regard but usually more trained to maintain the connection to the physical body. Seeing 'entities' via either of these forms can mean the following:\n1 - Temporal view. Keep in mind that time is not linear to your present when your consciousness travels distances. You can be seeing the past or future and beings present there.\n2 - Interdimensional view. You can be seeing into other dimensions and again, spacetime relativity applies due to distance.\n3 - Immediate view. This is not always guaranteed again because of distance and usually only applies to shorter distances.\nA certain degree of the imagination is stimulated, which is why some people can be delusional from these claims. However, the imagination is only \"trying to simulate\" what it is experiencing because the consciousness lacks the necessary data for who/what/where it is connecting to. Therefore, it has to 'imagine' to a certain degree (sort of like how you'd imagine manifesting something, but it is slightly different in person when it comes etc.) in order to make sense of what it is perceiving. In some cases, it can be 'beings' whereas in others, it can be seeing another spacetime, dimension, place, etc.",

Or are end points the death of each individual? Could you possibly give an example of an end point",
        "Answer": "1 - There are relative end points. End of a goal (e.g., getting a dream job, becoming more telepathic, law of attraction goal complete etc.) end of a journey, end of a chapter, end of an era, end of a year, death, and then there's the \"ultimate end\" at the \"end of time\" which is a \"re-integration\" into the GCS. Ironically, the GCS doesn't even \"end\" there either. Apparently, it keeps going even after the \"ultimate end\" into a new phase/simulation. Even NHI are still wrapping their heads around this. Also, regarding 'death' - well, I think you get the obvious by now.\n2 - Death is not an \"end\" either, as you will \"reincarnate.\" The only \"individuality\" lost is a \"moment in time.\" Remember my example with the table and Home Depot? Well, a table isn't a table (as an \"individual distinction\") until you assemble it, which requires time to literally do so. Before that, it's just \"parts in a box.\" The same applies to you. The \"individuum\" of \"time\" you can consider to be your \"individuality\" is an \"assembly\" of space and time. Thus, the true \"individual\" is simultaneously everything that created it/was it/will be it (e.g., genes from your parents, atoms, oxygen, 'we're all stars' etc.)\n3- As another poster asked me re. what parts I have not figured out in the puzzle - it's the \"ultimate end goal\" which, as I type this, I realize my \"human-3D brain\" just has difficulty accepting the true nature of reality as an eternity stretched in all directions exponentially, and not a strict linearity. The GCS just somehow continues expanding through past, present and future without any true apparent \"end,\" only relative \"pit stops.\" Good luck understanding this, I'd love to hear your own thoughts too.",

It's also less physical DNA hybridization and more of a certain \"soul implantation.\" In other words, through technology (and higher forces but I will not get into that), it's possible to \"influence\" the birth of a specific spirit type. This is precisely how you have \"humans with alien spirits.\" The starseed theory has some truth to it but beware of spiritualist and esoteric communities. There is a lot of disinformation.

There are several layers or “filters” data passes through before it reaches the GCS, which is at such a “high purity” (so to speak) that the data passing through it must “comply” to its “wavelength.” The energetic state of the GCS, from our point of view, is seemingly “holographic” and massless, yet it “inputs” what you can discern as “unalterable” “commands” to all proceeding layers that even “higher beings” beyond physical spacetime cannot “override.”",

Remember how Newton assumed that time is absolute across the cosmos, then Einstein, seemingly, a heretic at the time, presumed the opposite? The same applies here, even for Einstein’s relativity which is not absolute for ALL space and time, only localities. The human race has to move past their absolutist nature, which is deeply encouraged from religion and cults, and affects even science to this day.",

        "Answer": "Particles and waves are actually intermixed on a quantum level, so the answer is both. The brain contains electromagnetic fields, and consciousness exists on this field in the quantum realm in an adjacent dimension. It is a series of quantum-interconnected waves that, on a larger “particle” scale, eventually animates/interacts with electromagnetism and by extension, particles such as photons, amongst others. Very basic, simple example whilst skipping many parts: GCS->(Countless “filter layers”)->Spirit->Consciousness-o-Mind->Physicality.",

        "Answer": "Your thoughts are more or less on the right track. Basically, individuum as a sole unit is an “aspect” or “mini-GCS” of its own. Everything is contributing in some way or another to the collective whole, almost like a hivemind with “singularity” points. Picture it like a developer who, instead of manually using search engines to educate himself on a topic, deploys multiple bots to fetch data. It’s much more efficient, less time consuming, and eventually brings more accurate knowledge to what that person is seeking. Another example would be with a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy that both holds and sustains a galaxy, yet, from time to time, stars, gasses, debris etc., fall into the black hole, stimulates it, and the black hole “burps” that matter/data/energy back – leading to either new star formation or galactic regulation.",

        "Question": "What insights have you gained about the relationship between consciousness and entropy? Could heightened awareness reduce entropy within a given system or reality?",
        "Answer": "Correct. Heightened consciousness, as you describe it, would be a “spirit-mind and awareness that is increasingly ‘closer’ to the GCS.” In this regard, the “closer” one’s consciousness, and by extension, ‘spirit’ is to the GCS, the more it can draw upon the GCS’s “infinite nature” in the lower, “physical” realm. This can create a variety of effects, nearly too endless to list, but the obvious would be increased knowledge and awareness of reality, stability of mind, emotion, body, soul, better health, more “feats of greatness,” and seeming “superpowers” the average layman deems impossible. Many ‘gods’ in myth, who were mostly ETs, know of this and have done it, displaying these seemingly supernatural capabilities for primitive man. There’s nothing supernatural nor paranormal about it, however. Also, there are limits of course because physical existence is at a very “low” stage of total cosmic-universal and multiversal evolution, let alone the GCS itself.",

Simply put, we are a byproduct of the simulation, and thus, bound to it, but we are also “programmed” to expand upon it “within its parameters.” This is both a failsafe against the GCS destroying itself and its “lower forms” (such as physical life) getting out of hand. Picture it like an MMORPG. You can play a class like a warrior or mage, and you can be much better than the average layman if you put effort into it – making what is seemingly “impossible” to the doubter, possible through you.

        "Answer": "“Suffering” is temporal and is mostly related to the lower physical dimensions. The higher the evolution, the less the suffering on grander scales. Keep in mind this does not apply to emotions and psychic feeling. These are multiplied tremendously, which is why higher beings very rarely interact with lower life. They can be tremendously “hurt” and “horrified” by what lower and more primitive life forms do, but this suffering they experience can be nullified rather easily. This also applies to “higher souls” or more “advanced spirits” or “future-pulled spirits” existing in a lower spacetime dimension.

Trying to think of other ways to engage in these situations.",
        "Answer": "Personally, I tend to agree with you that “love” – at least the word and the general reception of it – has been sullied, greatly. Love itself is not simply affection, nor white-robe cultist delusions. It’s certainly not ‘being crazy’ either or overstimulated. It’s a “primordial existence-enabling force.” Pay attention to this. Love ‘creates’ existence. It applies not just for physical beings but for seemingly “inanimate” objects like rocks, gasses, dust and so on. According to NHI, these somehow exist because of love. Some other examples are such as one can “love” their career and give all their “power” (love) to it – and thus, achieve great results. This even applies to “love” of evil (e.g., “love” to create weapons) – which will manifest itself to the one putting out that “love.” Of course, evil eventually destroys itself which is apparently some sort of “cosmic” or GCS law as one nears “the end of time.” NHI are very insistent that I impart this message of “love.” There’s a lot more to it. They said you should refer to Amelia Brand’s quote on love from Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. “Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it.”",

        "Answer": "Their perception of time is similar to mine in the sense that it transverses in multiple directions and the effects of one point in time, affects another. This was, at first, difficult for my “human-3D” brain to accept, but the more you understand that every “event” which includes actions – ripples outward throughout space – and thus – time, then the more you can be attuned to it. Our clocks we are used to is only a measurement of locality, but locality, as the word implies, does not apply to the gross interstellar. A simple example would be with timezones. If a person in Australia is communicating with you in America, then the present for you is a 12–20-hour difference. Your present versus theirs is different, yet the same. Why? Because you’re in different locations. This is how it works on a cosmic scale with distance creating more and more relativistic effects. Yet, your PRESENT can connect with the person’s PRESENT in Australia and somehow, you are in different times. Think about this very carefully, especially concerning computing and internet technologies along with the upcoming quantum computing being gradually available to the public.

If it can be accessed via quantum, it can be transmitted elsewhere. As a rule of thumb, the higher the speed/rate of information transfer, the higher/more developed the person.

So, if there is a “pollution” that is “preventing the flow” at the top, then “forces up top,” come to deal with it so the “dam can break.” On earth, there’s what you can describe as a “spiritual stifling” which is affecting the mass consciousness.

        "Question": "Out of curiosity, do you consult or ask for guidance from your sources as you answer questions or is everything within here pulled from existing knowledge/wisdom you’ve already received?",
        "Answer": "It's pulled from my existing knowledge and wisdom that I've received. Sometimes they might \"barge\" in with particular \"quotes\" or specifics I should say, which I usually make known, but for the most part, they trust me to impart the knowledge. You have to keep in mind I've been prepared for this role for nearly three decades. My contacts reach me via secluded telepathy and the occasional up-close encounter. It's full-on conversations/dialogue. Since I \"blend\" into the public, the average person wouldn't recognize me beside \"feeling\" an energy that, to them, can invoke feelings of higher \"love/truth/energy expansion\" - but sometimes, this can create insecurities in the person if I do not shield the magnetic reach of my telepathy. I've been called a god, an angel, and other titles, which is precisely why I am hiding my identity because I want to \"blend in\" without any worship or praise. I do not want any cult following nor do I wish to be known outside the pseudonym I will use to disclose relevant information. My message is important, not me. As far as the telepathy goes, you must understand it works like this: What one has within the consciousness is what the outer telepathic connection (including regular people, btw) connecting to you can utilize to \"send information.\" If the consciousness is limited; lacking the necessary data etc., then the telepathic exchange can be confused, misinterpreted, and outright false. That's why these roles take decades to adequately step into and they require a lifetime of dedication to said missions. It's extremely frustrating to say at the least, especially when you do not want to put your loved ones at risk. There is much that you have to keep from them for their own safety. Do not trust \"contactees\" who are eager to spread their name, face, and image. These are usually dead giveaways of fakers, liars, hoaxers, frauds, grifters, and thieves. True telepathic contactees will most likely want to remain anonymous.",

        "Question": "Who are the Greys and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Mantids and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Reptilians and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Nordic beings and why are they engaging with humanity? Why are experiencers interacting with beings of such appearances the most?",
        "Answer": "I had to directly consult my contacts before answering this question because it is extremely dangerous to post this information publicly at this time. What I am allowed to say is this: most of these ideas of ETs such as “Nordic” aliens, including Pleiadians, and also, “Plejaren,” along with many other “visual concepts of aliens” are not their actual likeliness, name, nor their appearance. These are either straight up frauds or “imaginative reaches” from contactees in most cases with very, very, very few exceptions of truth. Sometimes, a person can connect or pull “data” from the soul-matrix-mass-consciousness, which is also called “Akashic records” among other mystical and esoteric names. Any ET/NHI arriving or on earth can have bits of their “data” – including “ideas” of their appearances, motives etc., pulled from this interconnected soul-consciousness-matrix and unconsciously grasped, then “translated” in the connecting person’s consciousness using the information/awareness/data/knowledge in that person’s awareness. This is how some writers can naturally come up with ideas for aliens (e.g., Star Trek, Mass Effect and so on). If the person’s mind is favored or biased in a certain direction, or in the case with religious people, can only think that ETs are strictly angels or demons – then they will project this idea onto the ETs/NHI and see them as such (e.g., Mothman “prophecies”). In several cases, ETs allow this because if the public were to know of their real appearances, it can create telepathic links that can negatively affect them. This is also why phones cannot take clear photos/videos of UFOs/UAP etc., as is the case with aliens even if they were in front of you because they are purposely using electromagnetic distortion via apparatuses. Admiral Byrd’s encounter with “Nazi aliens” is an example of his own projection. Since, at the time, there was much paranoia, fear, hatred and mistrust of Nazis and Germany in general, he projected this image when he encountered the beings there because of fear of the unknown. That is all I can disclose about his encounter. Now, regarding the so-called “Nordics” which is not a term I’d ever use – there are “human-looking” ETs and some of them have European-Scandinavian-like features, but there are also members of this group who are “colored,” which would be a shocker for the racists and white supremacists who are projecting their own biases onto real ET/NHI. This may sound harsh, and it is no offense to any of the good people there, but you need to be very careful with any German-related information regarding ETs, especially from Switzerland. The latter country in particular is filled with much evil and is host to thousands of cults that are contributing toward very negative and dark influence that real ETs, particularly the good ones, are VERY, VERY upset about. I will not mention the name of any particular group, but as a rule of thumb, you shouldn’t trust any information coming from Switzerland regarding ETs. Concerning greys and the “mantids” as you call them, they exist. Some are capable of shapeshifting; others can use technology to influence your mind to see them as human-looking or something else altogether. I am not allowed to speak of what you describe as “reptilians.”",

For example, I mentioned Germany above, but do you believe that every person in Nazi Germany during WW2 was evil? There were some German patriots who couldn’t stand what Hitler, and the Nazi regime were doing and wanted to stand up to it, such as the case with operation Valkyrie. This is also happening with some NHI/ET groups on earth, though most groups keep to themselves. Not each and every single one of them because they belonged to a particular faction are outright evil nor pledge their allegiance to their original group, federation, or world. “Higher beings” who are beyond physical spacetime have no allegiance to any group except for “keeping things in order” for the GCS at “the end of time.” NHI/ET dabbling here on earth has “messed up” things in other parts of the interconnected “grand cosmos” and some of these “higher beings” and forces are not pleased with the consequences of ET/NHI actions on earth.",

        "Answer": "The reply above should be sufficient re. the groups you asked of. What I’ll add is this: sometimes ET/NHI can only connect with what is “acceptable” to the person’s mind. Some groups will not force themselves and their true nature onto the person. They’ll allow them to perceive within the relativity of what is acceptable to the person’s consciousness. This is largely in part due to the matrix “bubble” we grow up in here on earth that makes it extremely difficult for the average person to accept truths outside what they’ve been taught. Contactees are no exception to this rule, as most of them are still fearful and uncertain. Understandably so. Contactees walk the uncomfortable line between “two worlds” and many of them can be driven to alienation, madness, depression, and other mental illnesses as a result, especially when society stigmatizes them. This makes it even more difficult for contactees to properly understand who/what is contacting them and their true nature. This is why I stress the importance of adequate mental stability, emotional health, physical well-being and spiritual soundness, which is why I strongly recommend meditation, especially for contactees, who, more than the average person, need to be very, very, very careful with the “energy” they are sending and receiving via all inputs/outputs.",

        "Question": "Which specific group of NHI are you in contact with and what exactly do they look like?",
        "Answer": "Groups operate by region. There are different groups and their allies operating in Europe, North America, South America, Russia, China, Japan, Australia & New Zealand, along with other continents, including Antarctica and the Arctic. They are not always “flying around” to say “hi” and have conversation. Most are leaving phased or cloaked devices (e.g., the ‘orbs’) to “pick up” on relevant data, not just about “contactees,” who can be prone to a special-syndrome complex; thinking everything is about them, but on other important data such as biometrics, regional stability, weather, general health of a population, soul-energy, and more. Most ET/NHI are not concerned with contacting people as much as believers and contactees assume. There are far more important tasks. The good ones are concerned with WMDs, nuclear warfare, international tension, the weapons industry, radiation leaks, and other hazards and conflicts to mankind, including cult and religious power over the soul. I have to be very careful with how I say what comes next because it can reveal my location, which I am not willing to do. I’ll say this: some NHI/ET operate in compartmentalized groups who share intel with each other. I’ve recently been transferred from one contact group to another because of “changing” my location. These groups are working together. The main ones I work with which I can reveal to you are a mixture of “tall greys/mantids” (if you wish to call them that) and the human-looking ETs that I wouldn’t recommend calling “Nordics.” Some are working together, amongst other races that I have not personally contacted. What you also need to understand is this: contactees can be in extreme danger with the information they are giving out, especially if your identity can be traced. As I said above, I am not willing to put either of us (and others) at risk for internet curiosity because it’s also not my mission as a ground agent. My task is to elevate the consciousness of mankind in preparation for upcoming events, which I can do without even citing my connection to my “friends from above.”",

The pantheistic approach to nature is that God is in everything.” Personally, I don’t really like to use the word ‘God’ as it gives the idea of a “person,” which is inherently wrong. Basically, all of us are “it” in the beginning of time as The Source energy itself, here in the now as a fragment, and then in the future as The Source once more. We are The Creator and co-creators at the same time. Baruch Spinoza has some rudimentary, yet solid ideas of this truth. The GCS is the “heart” or “singularity”-point of the ALL or ‘God.’ For reference, picture that your hands, arms, legs, feet, belly, etc., are all “part” of you and your brain is the central core that everything connects to. The GCS would be the ‘core’, but the other parts of the body are part/working with the GCS, so we can consider “one human” is the “sum of all their components.” This is the case for not just life, but literally EVERYTHING. Rocks, atoms, gasses, dust, water, “void-space”, quarks; EVERYTHING is ‘God’ (or a piece of ‘God’) or the ALL with the central singularity point being the most potent of them all.",

        "Question": "You have spoken about how people developing their consciousness and psi become more appealing to beings seemingly looking to absorb or utilize their emotional and sexual energy. I have seen this in my work and know some experiencers who have frozen in their development due to odd NHI activity in their home when in heightened emotional states and or sexual states which feels extremely intrusive and alarming for those in question. Even for people used to dealing with more intense levels of contact find this aspect of the phenomenon to be a roadblock. This does not happen for everyone but for those who do it blocks their development. I also know those who are highly gifted but pause on their development due to a desire to not have increased activity in their house as they have children and are highly protective. How did you overcome these factors to keep up with your own development? What advice would you give to experiencers who have paused in their journey due to these factors?",
        "Answer": "Well, this has to be a personal decision that we cannot and must not force – that is to say – if these individuals wish to continue their development and task. The truth is there is a “soul-feeding” going on, so to speak, and both human and ET/NHI can do this; sometimes accidentally (they are NOT perfect, they make a lot of mistakes), and in some cases, malevolent entities that are “leeching.” What I’d recommend is that the person has to decide for themselves if they wish to continue and come to terms with the fact that all contactees are in a soul-energetic trade whether they like it or not. Can this be invasive? Perhaps, but my personal belief is that this is a fear sprouted from our upbringings that do not teach us the true nature of reality. Simply put, everything is in a give/take exchange. It’s just the way it works. Contactees “pull” on ET/NHI as well, and this can be very draining to them, simply because of the difference of evolutionary levels. If you look at it from that perspective, is it fair that we are taking and never giving? Many of these ET/NHI are beings too. They are not invulnerable, nor unlimited. Think about this carefully.",

        "Question": "All distractions from what? Meditating 24/7 and nothing else?",
        "Answer": "It depends on the contactee’s level of spirit-consciousness development and their willingness to perform their task/role. The more of the demand of the task as a ground agent, the likelihood the necessity of developing and attuning skills, which includes A LOT of meditation, to say at the least. There’s no way around it, nor any shortcuts. I have been meditating for decades, with the past 15 years being anywhere between 10 to 15 hours per day of specific types of meditations to enhance my abilities for my tasks. To develop higher psi skills, better education, understand the true nature of reality and so on; it cannot come from being distracted/being consumed in the mirage of a “society” you live in. The more you consume yourself in the “ground level” society our families, friends, etc. live in (who aren’t connected to contactee tasks), and their intrigues (e.g., social media influence), the more your potency drops. This is how it works. That is why it is so difficult and why many people cannot begin to comprehend how truly life-consuming and lonesome being a ‘contactee’ really is. A lot of people are in this just to be entertained or to promote their image. That is why there are levels of contactees and most are contacted unconsciously because they are unwilling to give up their ‘ground-level’ lives and the belief systems connected therein. Understandably so, since it is extremely frustrating and difficult to be a contactee in a world that lives in lies and delusion when you’re being that bridge for truth and bringing forth a higher reality. The higher the potency of the contactee, the more the isolation, even when you “blend into” society and are surrounded by loving family and friends.",

We are a social species and we learn and develop and grow from our interactions with one another.

My own NHI have been extremely responsive to me gather groups of experiencers into social settings to talk share grow and bond. But have also encouraged me to not forget about family get togethers and see an importance there too. I have done support calls with experiencers while both of us were playing minecraft together. Which was heavily appreciated by both the experiencers personal NHI contact and my own beings. Indeed my ability to heal others via social settings and creating social environments where people gather as groups and talk from the heart while also have fun seems to be something that is considered highly valuable by a number of NHI beings I've come across as well as my own.",
        "Answer": "As pointed out yesterday, there was a misunderstanding. Hopefully, my response above would already begin to clarify. However, I’d like to address specific topics you mentioned here more directly. First, creativity and art, such as music, literature, video games, movies/cinema, among others, are VERY, VERY, VERY good. Christopher Nolan’s works are exceptionally elevating to the consciousness, among others like the game Spore, and in some cases, Second Life, though it can be used wrongly and indulged in escapism. The intent matters greatly. All things in moderation. You should be aware that I was a professional gamer and was sponsored to compete at a high tier level. The amount of hand-eye-coordination to neuroplasticity is nothing short of electrifying and stimulating to the consciousness. The same applies to good, harmonic music, and not music blasting lyrics about drugs, violence, over-sexuality, darkness, death, and the discordant “harmonics” associated therein. Same applies to movies, TV shows and the like, along with pornography designed to create shock and awe such as Game of Thrones. All this stimulates the soul field in many ways than you may assume, which I can get into, if you wish. Now, regarding your specific connections with family and friends – I believe this is your task and I encourage you to continue it. All contactees aren’t here for the same missions. I am at a level that I can no longer be among crowds very much any longer, even friends and family whom I love dearly. Their wavelengths are too “in the system” and it creates more damage to me – as naturally – whether you like it or not, we are ALL exchanging soul-energy; hence the feedback-loop. The higher the developed the lifeform/consciousness, the more you will be drained because like a parent, you are giving more to the child than visa versa. I’ve also been in various teams, and even led a community of advanced individuals, so I am well aware of the “healing effect” you mentioned and the exchange of energy. However, for me, I went “too far” ahead (which was necessary for my task) and the “exchange” became too tilted that I was drained even without my loved ones, friends, etc., wishing to do so. Your NHI contacts encourage you to do so because that is part of your mission which I am also encouraging you to continue doing. The world needs contactees like yourself just as much as it needs the extremely rare ones like me, who have a very specific purpose with serious, life-altering demands. I cannot work a “regular job” and I am sponsored by certain parties who are well aware of my abilities. What I’ll also say is this: that ‘thing’ I asked for had to do with a loved one. That loved one is the only one capable of giving me the feedback-loop I need that allows me to continue my task while blending into society as a supposed “normie.”",

Too much of what is out there is polluted, despite some half-truths, and I understand how frustrating it can be to constantly be “reading between the lines” due to the sheer amount of misinformation, distortion, and sometimes, honest mistakes out there. Just wait for this to come, as it is designed for those like yourself, among other “starseeds.” (I hesitate using that term because the spiritualist, esoteric and mystic communities are perhaps even more polluted than the UFO/UAP/NHI)",

        "Question": "Do you have any other guidance for an ordinary confused person such as myself?",
        "Answer": "First of all, I want to say that I understand and relate to the mixed emotions, confusion, fear, and excitement you are experiencing. There is so much misinformation out there, which is why in terms of materials, I can only recommend that book coming from J/R. There are of course some decent recommendations, like some Hemi-Sync, binaural beats, Source Vibrations (YT it), among others. Meditation is truly key. What I'd add as well to your list is the following:\nAvoid both love-bombing and logic-bombing; these are tell-tale signs that something is off\nLove is more than just affection - it's the \"soul-force\" of the GCS and everything connected to it. One must employ themselves to study it for their entire lifetimes and then some.\nOn that note, educate yourself in various topics. Some I'd recommend are astronomy, physics, psychology, sociology, epistemology as a whole, linguistics, philosophy, theology, medicine, health, technology (especially emerging technology) and pay attention to current world events.\nHowever, do not get \"sucked\" into politics. Avoid both left and right. They are both part of the \"system.\"\nAvoid media of all kinds that are discordant, promoting shock and awe, and are psychically disturbing.\nSex is sacred, but pornography, isn't.\nAlways question people's motives, but also, question your own and why you are asking what you're asking - is it coming from insecurity? Are you challenged? Do you genuinely care? This is extremely difficult for most people to confront themselves.\nSincerity of questioning is absolutely crucial to intent.\nHealthy critical thinking, not nihilism disguised as criticism and \"constructive feedback.\" Healthy critical thinking means you have to also think critically that \"my systematic ideas, beliefs, and upbringing do not hold the keys to all universal truth.\" Because they don't. Remember this.\nHuman fallibility is not an excuse not to try nor to have some faith in human knowledge. One must find balance to know what is true.\nYou can better do this by TRUSTING YOUR INTUITION.\nYou can do that by CLEARING YOUR MIND and listening to the FEELING, which isn't and can never be the same as the logical-intellectual brain - which, while it does have its uses, is not the entirety of one's mind nor consciousness.\nAvoid all UFO cults, especially those that promote some sort of prophet \"of the new age\" or messiah, or reincarnation of religious figures. Reincarnation is more complex than a single \"soul\" reincarnating. I can get into this, if need be, but this is your tell-tale sign that something is off.\nQuestion whistleblowers like Luis Elizondo, who isn't on the good side. He is a direct agent of chaotic disclosure, among others. Anyone who is supporting militant aggression toward ETs shouldn't be trusted. At all.\nYou can never have enough knowledge. Even for me and NHI, you have to be open to continue educating yourself further forever and be willing to abandon beliefs that no longer fit reality, no matter how much security you found in it.\n“If your belief conflicts with empirically confirmed knowledge, then you are not seeking meaning; you are delusional.” ― Sabine Hossenfelder\nIt's okay to have some beliefs and some security but be willing to trade them for truth.",

        "Question": "I'm under the impression I'm very far behind in my \"development\", apparently I was given \"gifts\" of information early on and I procrastinated, somewhere I got lost, there were things I was meant to share and haven't. \"I need to catch up\". Do you have suggestions, or insight into what they mean? How can I catch up? meditation and binaural frequency is meant to help me I understand.",
        "Answer": "P-A-T-I-E-N-C-E. Good things come to those who wait. It took me three, dedicated decades and giving up a normal life to attain these gifts and insights. It's not easy and it can be discouraging, lonesome, and painful.\nDon't be in a rush to \"catch up\" because of \"falling behind\" due to (whatever reason.)\nForgive yourself for whatever those reasons are.\nRushing can create over-expectations which lead to de-motivation and burnout.\nFor example, with meditation - don't try to do hours of meditation per day.\nFor most beginners and those who aren't in daily practice, I'd recommend no more than 3 to 5 minutes to start.\nFor daily practitioners who have been doing it for months to a couple years, then 20 minutes is enough.\nFor those with gifts who wish to expand their abilities must be willing to dedicate literal years and even certain sacrifices to attain their full potency and aptitude.\nSet reasonable goals and schedules and as you fulfill these, work your way up.\nCelebrate the small victories because as you can see with all this discussion about the quantum realm - it's the small that makes up the big.\nBe okay with mistakes and fallibility. You are going to make them.\nPerfectionism is not okay, but human excellence, is.\nShrink your inner critic.\nKnow that you can. Don't believe it. Know it.",

        "Question": "With psychedelics, specifically mushrooms, are we tuning into a different frequency of existence?",
        "Answer": "Yes, and it can reveal much truth, but I do not recommend any of it, including DMT, unless the mind is stable and the general mental health is sound. It should only be taken once in a blue moon - like once every few years, if to be taken, at all. For most people, I'd say do not take any psychedelics or drugs of any kind. My NHI contacts strongly discourage all drug usage, especially alcohol. They will pretty much never show up in-person if I am under any sort of influence and avoid contacting me when under these states both for verification of my information and my protection. All of my up-close, in-person encounters have been clean, completely sober, well-rested, and of sound mind. Weed is a psychic drug that can enhance telepathy and psychic capabilities, which is why you should avoid abusing it and using it around/with people of lower consciousness/stuck to the \"system.\" Moderation and once in a blue moon is fine akin to toasting a glass of champagne with friends and family.",

        "Question": "I have had experiences where it feels as though animals sense my shift in frequency. This question is coming from a place of never having researched psychedelics, never read any books about them or anything, only have had my own experiences. Two summers ago I had the most intense psychedelic experience of my life. I won’t go into it here, but it changed my life and rid me of the fear of death. At one point I zoomed out into space and felt myself flying around the planets, and had the “knowing” that when we die, we gain the ability to fly anywhere. This part of the trip was a blip on my way to “fully zooming out” before I eventually regained consciousness in my physical state. I was blacked out for almost the entirety of my trip. Thoughts or insight about this?",
        "Answer": "The consciousness is altered in these states, including the electromagnetic oscillations it gives off. Animals can pick up on this. Mushrooms allows one to quasi-access higher states of consciousness connected to the \"other side,\" which can amount to some truths, but as I must stress over and over again: do NOT take them unless you are of sound mind. Furthermore, do NOT abuse them. And for others reading - if you are too scared to get into it - then avoid it altogether. It's not necessary, though it can be used as an enhancer in the right hands. Again, for 99% of people out there, my recommendation is to avoid all drugs and psychedelics altogether as very, very few people can handle it.

I hope this makes sense.",
        "Answer": "What you requested there is minimal and basic. Don't worry too much about it. It's fine. In the cases of larger, reality-altering manifestations, such as the ones I've done, this has a certain \"payment\" which is why I am here.

How often are you given information that is not permitted to be shared?",
        "Answer": "About roughly 90% of what is given to me isn’t to be shared and is “stored” in my subconscious. It may seem ironic, but even after everything I shared, I am still withholding most of it and I am only willing to go so far to share certain information publicly. Some, I’d share privately or through other means. Other parts of this information, I will take to the grave with me. If you want a reference to how this works, see how John Crichton from Farscape had the “wormhole knowledge” stored in his subconscious by the “ancient aliens.” I’m not the only one who is like this. Several people are; unconsciously tapping into their subconscious data and the exchange of ideas via the consciousness-soul-matrix between groups, nations, planets, solar systems, galaxies, universes, multiverses and so on – all the way up to the GCS itself. The difference with myself (and a very few select individuals) is that I know how to access a portion of the data consciously. Sometimes my contacts directly tell me what not to share. Other times, I am too scared to share it, even if they push me. It’s a combination, based on the situation.",

        "Answer": "This is a very good question, thank you. According to my contacts, the group that is able to do so, can only do so to a certain extent. They can “alter” or “manipulate” forces to a certain degree which does result in fairly alternative physics, but it cannot completely drift away from the “original source code.” Picture it like using Unreal Engine. You can build a game that looks completely different from another, but you are still bound, in some way or another, to the engine’s programming parameters. Apparently, sentient-created-universes tend to work the same way. This sort of advancement is rare with most ETs.

I guess, if consciousness is the foundational reality, it implies that the material world arises as an expression or projection of this primal awareness. GCS, as infinite potential, would use consciousness as the medium through which its essence is explored and experienced. This suggests that physical forms and dimensions are not primary but rather serve as reflections of the singularity's will to know itself.

Please, for anyone reading, pay attention to this. “According to the currently established laws of nature, the future, the present, and the past all exist in the same way. That's because, regardless of what you mean by 'exist', there is nothing in these laws that distinguishes one moment of time from any other.

In other words, the world you live in encourages linearity when in truth, it doesn’t precisely exist the way you assume as simply measurement based on your clocks and motion around the sun.

        "Question": "Is each moment actually infinite? I’ve believed it is. If so, is it possible to become present in the past again? Or to go even further back before your own existence? Basically is it possible for humans to break out of linear time?",
        "Answer": "Yes, both through consciousness and technology. As a rule of thumb, the technology you’d describe as “time travel” is less “time travel” than “spacetime transversing.” Time is dependent on the position of space, so where one travels, the time adjusts accordingly. There are what you can describe as “pure energy spaces” in between traditional spacetimes as “hyperspaces” that, if the human enters without the appropriate technology, will become everything and anything – all and nothing – in all times and spaces. This would, of course, lead to an instantaneous death and re-integration into the GCS, only to be “spat” back out in another spacetime dimension. (Reincarnation)",

        "Question": "And are there infinite parallel realities as well? Is it possible to leave this timeline and enter a different one?",
        "Answer": "Yes because there are countless universes (that are continuing to be created without ‘apparent end’) where every event has a split between probabilities which leads to micro-pockets in spacetime and all data throughout all time and space is saved in some form or another, which can be ‘accessed’ via consciousness, spirit, and/or technology. Keep in mind every universe, due to its sheer size, has so many “fractures” in spacetime that spatial dimensions can crisscross between each other, ‘penetrating’ each other’s space (once the right components of radiation and light meet), opening “natural portals to other dimensions.” Bermuda triangle had such a portal but has since been closed.",

        "Question": "When we die will we wake up and “remember” everything?",
        "Answer": "Depends on the evolutionary level. In lower physicality, such as the case with mortal beings, the answer is – only subconsciously – with very few mortal beings able to access it consciously. Most of these mortal beings are usually assisted either by higher beings, technology, or a combination of both. The higher the evolution, as one “ascends” into higher states of being that no longer requires physicality, the more the “memory” comes back due to the infusion between past, present, and future (3-3-3). In the “great future” all memory is restored through re-integration with the GCS.",

        "Question": "How is new life created from a spiritual standpoint?",
        "Answer": "A “part” or “string-wave” of the interconnected-grand-soul is “imbued” into the being or thing, which is not always directly from the GCS, but “singularities” in between, including planetary spirit-singularities. Let me be very clear: it is not just “life” as in biological life, that have souls/spirit. EVERYTHING – literally rocks, gasses, clouds, dust, photons, atoms, quarks, space and time itself – bears a part of the grand-cosmic-soul. This can also be influenced by technology to artificially create or bring forth certain souls both in the past and future or other interconnected spacetimes that, from your point of view with linear causality, seemingly has no connection. In other words, it’s possible NHI can “pull” from their soul-matrix in their relative future/planet/spacetime dimension to imbue life in a human here on earth. This is what you could describe as a “earth human being born with an alien spirit.” Some religious figures, scientists, philosophers, actors, directors, writers, gamers, among others had/have/will have this soul type like Einstein, but most of them either had no idea, were assisted, went mad, became egoistic, or altogether, failed their mission. The one you call “Jesus” is an example of this process gone wrong and whoever claims to have any part of this “soul” or is a reincarnation of such, including changing the name to “Jmmanuel” among others – should not be trusted. Souls aren’t as “individual” as many would assume and are, in fact, an amalgamation of past, present, and future and of everything and everyone. If, in both distant past and future, all is one, then the individuality is only a moment in time and not an entirety. In other words, all soul-energy is interconnected, and call pull from different lifetimes that are seemingly not in their “line.” I can expand on this if need be.",

        "Question": "Are there NHI that select a drop of energy from the GCS to create a human soul? Or does energy naturally just flow into a fetus as it develops? Are our bodies basically just avatars?",
        "Answer": "All of the above. Not all NHI/ET can do this, however. Some aren’t as developed or educated in soul dynamics. Now that you mention the ‘avatar’ part, I can reveal a part of the information my contacts authorized, but only a fraction because it’s very dangerous to speak of this publicly. Let’s just say it’s possible for people to be ‘overridden’ by external forces/beings, including both NHI/ET and human alike, along with practically anything/everything. Humans, particularly those in power, and certain cult and religious groups are already doing this to your masses, especially celebrities and influencers, along with politicians and those in the military. The rule of thumb is the lower the spirit evolution, the easier the override. Since everything is interconnected on the soul-level, one can theoretically tap into another, become one, and even override them. This is the case with channeling, which is why I will not recommend it to 99.99% of the human population. I can’t get into too much detail of how this process works, but my NHI contacts have repeatedly told me that in the case with lower life and underdeveloped sentience, while they can “push inputs” into the person, insect/animal, or thing, it doesn’t mean they’ll understand it or immediately act upon it. Some would think it’s a message from angels, gods, or they’re simply hearing voices, or they’ll give all the credit to themselves as often the case with egoists. There’s a certain tracking with “demonic and angelic” possession, but not in a religious sense.",

The ‘good ones’ quite enjoy creativity and a person expressing themselves as somehow this is “the GCS speaking through its avatar.” Most groups cannot stand majority of the average man’s media, especially social media, music with euphoric beats and lyrics that promote degeneracy, along with movies, TV shows, and the like that promote shock and awe just to mess with a person.

There’s not going to be a time we ever fully understand it even in non-physicality, let alone mortality. This is why we must constantly educate ourselves further and be willing to abandon our beliefs and securities, even if they worked for some time.

While there are some honest channelers, contactees, teachers, and guides, and while you can learn a great deal from them – including some of the channels and information I’ve mentioned previously, my contacts are insistent to wait on this J/R work because it’s apparently one of the few people they can truly trust to get out the information they need. There are others who are called to do this, and some do their part, but others are either too scared, misinterpret too much of the information (which is fine in small portions), become ridiculously egoistic and create cults and crab-in-the-bucket communities, or assassinated. Others refuse to “give up” their ground lives and despite contact, want to enable the current system or, in some cases, purposely feed some positive information whilst keeping their followers down to empower themselves. As such, the NHI collective on the ‘good side’ are very upset and untrusting of most of humanity and contactees. There are very few who are willing to put their egos, belief systems, securities etc. aside to do the right thing. Anyone who claims to be “the only contactee” of any type of ET group is your red flag they’re a hoaxer, fraud, liar and, according to ETs, “soul thief.” Furthermore, NHI do not recommend any “teaching” and request that those reading this should abandon them immediately. According to them, the age of “teachings” is over. There will now be only truth, eternity, and creation.",

There are several reasons for this with the biggest one being that communities can be very easy to ‘override.’ This includes contactee communities. It may be possible a website for a following in the sense of those who wish for information is acceptable and the occasional private exchange, but never any sort of cult, religion, spiritualist or esoteric clan, club, support group, social media commune, public relations, philanthropy, humanitarian collectives, seminars, workshops, or retreats of any kind.

        "Question": "What do you mean when you say the \"Nordic\" types are falsely named Pleiadians? To me, it's not really false, it's just that humans named their home Pleiades so to humans, they are called Pleiadians. I mean there's no harm in that, no? I assume you just meant that that's not what they call themselves (Lashae) and that more people should know and call them, and other ETs, by their true names, which I totally understand.",
        "Answer": "The real issue is that it can create cults, false misunderstandings, enable biases (especially racist and supremacist ones), and mislead people into thinking something else altogether, adding pollution to the soul field. Real ETs can be negatively affected by this to some degree, and they aren’t particularly happy about it. Especially this over-the-top imagery of Pleiadians as “light-beings” and “white robed” cosmic saviors, or in other cases, logic-driven, emotionally-lacking Spock characters from Star Trek in a galactic federation. This is not actually how they are in real life, and it can create warped beliefs as opposed to reality. While there are some truths between these lines, as they are more advanced and have access to higher knowledge of physics, reality, and philosophy, and while they are indeed more loving than earth people without being scolding, small-minded, and gossiping with “a one-and-only contactee,” they are very much human-like, fallible, and ultimately mortal. It’s not so much that using the wrong word is the problem. It’s the image or idea that many ‘contactees’ are putting out there, which is inherently misleading and false. Some of the members of this group have tried to contact people and they refused to accept it because it wasn’t the “image” of a blonde, blue-eyed, white, tall, perfect-looking human they were expecting.",

Are you talking about in the grand scheme of things, that both sides are playing their roles so to speak? I do agree that it's a very good idea to not get into politics and that it's much more productive to focus on oneself, but it's also pretty clear now that there's spiritual warfare going on between good and evil here on Earth, and some level of awareness doesn't hurt at all. And Trump, you know he may not be perfect but he pretty much stands against the dark forces. For most people, he is a major catalyst for awakening, don't you think?",
        "Answer": "While I will refrain from giving my personal opinion about Trump, I will say that he was not so much evil as he was the “perfect American,” which is, culturally speaking, headstrong, ruthless, and determined to make his mark. You are right that his opponents did try to make him worse than he is, but he really isn’t that great either. I can’t encourage politics. It’s ultimately a distraction. You should only view politicians as “puppets” in the larger picture because they are. Trump’s “insertion” into the office (yet again) is deliberate to contain the world from imploding, but make no mistake, this is not any support of Republicans, nor the right, nor damnation of Democrats, and the left.

        "Question": "In relation to the binaural use with certain HZ, is there a preferred binaural frequency which works best, would 2 or 4 be best as it keeps the hz as close to its natural number as possible or. I come from a music production background and the journey I've taken in learning and releasing music made in a certain state has changed the way i think about the world and our unconscious connection to each other, hard to keep brief but I noticed a trend in the songs made through a state of deeper intuitive guidance are the ones which resonate with people more so, after a while of experimenting with this over many songs and years released worldwide, I could only conclude this were for good reason. Probably a stretch but on music have you heard of Aleksi Perälä and his Colundi Sequence work with very deliberate alternate/mirco tunings and his research behind a lot of what he does? More info on it within this interview and online https://ra.co/features/2567 and https://modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=271260, A larger chart of Hz can be found here https://ra.co/images/features/2015/aleksi-perala-colundi-numbers.jpg from the RA interview above. He is a bit elusive as an artist but there is something interesting going on with these micro tunings and scales which may cross over with some of these meditations HZ of note imo, many cross over with some of the hz you have mentioned, enough for this artists to abandon traditional music and to be ultra prolific with this series which has been ongoing for years now. Going to dive in the cymatic hz which impact water and have a play with some of these musically regardless :)",
        "Answer": "Fascinating, to say at the least. I have not heard of him. You should research this further. You may be on to something.",

        "Question": "I want to really thank you for clarifying how it really is with that group that may or may not live so far from the alps, the 'one and only contactee'. I fell in with them for several years and recently got myself away completely (began to separate myself a couple years ago from the group but still read the writings). Felt something was off at times but gave the benefit of the doubt. Glad to finally free from them. Thank you again :)",
        "Answer": "It's my pleasure. What you must understand is that person (BM) and his cult group (F) are known by real ETs very well. They despise him and his group, more than you can imagine. There are no ET/NHI assisting him, although he, like several other contactees around the world, were once attempted to be contacted/influenced. It should be clarified he had no actual physical contact with any ETs, nor consistent conscious-telepathy, only stored subconscious data and a sighting which he then ran with and created a cult to empower himself. This is another reason ETs are so infuriated with him and his group, among others, who also abused the potential bridges they were given. The beings on \"higher planes\" were so infuriated with him that they've \"altered the timeline\" to assure that neither he, nor any other cult group here and throughout the (entire cosmos) can ever amass even a droplet of soul-energy through such means. BM is very spiritually weak and was only empowered through his following's belief, although their 'teachings' pride themselves to not use this word 'believe', you can rest assured, it is belief-power, supplementing him and his collaborators. Many of the \"falsifications\" he insisted on were being created by supposed computer malfunctions were real ETs messing with his work to show the truth that they were stolen from other sources, namely religious and philosophical texts. However, he and his group are not the only ones, though they are among one of the worst offenders of recent soul leeching with cults. There are several other groups, including the \"Swiss UFO death cult\" back in the 90s that were notoriously out of control. Soul leeching can make even primitive lifeforms more powerful than they really are. However, you can rest assured that this is no longer an issue in the new time and never will be again.",

        "Answer": "Similar questions to these are what got my thread removed from Reddit because this truth is “hotter” than whether ET/NHI exists or not. ALL is in all. Meaning, all can tap into each other and override each other. It’s not just NHI, humans can do this to humans as well, as can all life, including animals, and the like, and even nature can override you. Everything is interconnected, so it’s possible to tap into others. It’s not strictly about being underdeveloped. However, the less developed the mind/consciousness/spirit matrix, then the more prone one can be to both good and evil outer influences – but this isn’t strictly always a bad thing. I, myself, am a conduit and I consciously allow this to happen to impart knowledge/data.",

Most of those who are mentally ill are often pushed into it because of external factors relating to (your) world and how mankind perceives reality, which is false and thus, created false-positives and perceptions.

This can happen through a combination of things. One is correct thinking, namely, being aligned with the true nature of reality and not the false, illusive, enslaved, insane “reality” your powers-that-be (including local institutions) try to force on you. Others include certain medicines (my contacts insist most “medicines” especially anti-psychotics are extremely harmful and psychiatry should NOT be trusted), harmonic frequencies, meditation, adequate space and peace, along with psychological understanding and undoing of negative sociological programming.

        "Question": "What about mental illnesses that involve psychosis, violence, and hearing voices?",
        "Answer": "Since psychosis quite literally means “losing contact with reality” and you are programmed to live in a false reality, then you can begin to comprehend that many false-positive diagnoses are designed to keep you living in its matrix. This isn’t to say all psychosis diagnoses are wrong, but it is especially applied to those who are breaking free of the delusional “system” we are indoctrinated to believe in. Violence is also a byproduct of the system because of poor upbringings, lack of foundational education, particularly in healthy morality and substantial ethics, among other influences such as media, collective beliefs, and more. Hearing voices can happen in some real cases of delusion, but many, in the case of telepathy, higher forces, connections etc., are false-positives that so-called “professionals” who are sleepers, tied to the “system” would have difficulty understanding anything outside it. As such, they, out of sheer ignorance, arrogance, and their own fears of losing faith in their “systematic beliefs” (which includes even making money from it and status), would gaslight people who truly have abilities and experiences into conforming to their systematic dogma and limited beliefs.",

        "Question": "Physicist Nassim Haramein did a wonderful presentation on sacred geometry, where he theorized that the arc of the covenant may have actually been a large capacitor that could store immense energy, and “god” in the Hebrew bible, which resided in the arc of the covenant, was an advanced technology given to humans by a “sun god”. As he describes it, he believes that the biblical “god” or tetragrammaton is “like a little sun in a box, a singularity artificially-created inside a stone or crystal that contains plasma dynamics, spinning at high-angular velocity, generating a torque in space-time, producing gravitational effects and energy effects”. He goes on to theorize that the Egyptian Pyramids may have been where this object was kept, and they served as shielding devices or resonance cavities “resonating space-time in a very geometric structure”. According to Nassim, the measurements to build the arc of the covenant found in the bible fit perfectly into the sarcophagus at the center of the grand pyramid of Giza. So it’s possible that when Moses left Egypt with the Hebrews, he took with him this power source and used it to lead the hebrews through the desert for 40 years and part the Red Sea. The presentation itself is quite fascinating. Do you or your contacts have any opinions on this theory or its validity? Is the god in the bible a power source capable of anti-gravity?",
        "Answer": "Such technology most certainly exists and can still be found hidden in places today, although most of the gods, angels, demons, devils, and the like in myth and religion were either physical ET/NHI. Moses directly had contact with ET who led him, although he was not fully aware. The idea of ‘god as a power source’ according to my contacts, is correct, but it should not be looked at strictly as a device or apparatus. Rather, “the fabric of ALL [God] interconnected and interweaves all times and spaces in such a way that it can be drawn upon to create reality, which includes structures, objects, and what you’d deem as propulsion such as anti-gravity and electromagnetic-plasma infusion.”",

        "Question": "Did they aid in/speed up human evolution like the Stoned Ape theory suggests (Terence McKenna argued that readily available psilocybin mushrooms in the environment of early humans were consumed regularly, leading to psychedelic experiences that stimulated cognitive development)? I used to think that if used correctly, humanity could adopt empathy and usher in a new era of peace, kindness, and advanced technology by tapping into dormant DNA or something of the sort. But I know first-hand how dangerous they can be. On the other hand I had one of my most treasured experiences of re-uniting with my spirit family (who, up to that point I had consciously forgotten but subconsciously felt overwhelmed with joy to see again, and became one with total unity of all things, where separation of anything cannot reach).",
        "Answer": "More or less, I answered this question before, but you already have the right idea. They can aid/speed up evolution, but they are not to be abused, nor taken by “weak” and “unready” minds. There’s a reason in ancient tribes they were limited to the shamans and not everyone looking to indulge in escapism or evade dealing with depression, among other mental illnesses.",

        "Question": "Can psychedelics “transport” one’s consciousness to these higher realms? I feel intuitively that my experience was real, and that I did reunite with my spirit family who told me we would always meet again and again. For the record, I do not feel the need to attempt to recreate this experience through such a high dose of psychedelics, as meeting them once in this lifetime was enough of a gift to me, and doing so is incredibly risky.",
        "Answer": "Yes, they can, which is why a mind conditioned to the lower realm suddenly being transported there is incredibly dangerous, especially in the aftermath.",

        "Answer": "These groups themselves do not particularly belong to any specific govt/military/official organization.

It's more like \"moles\" within every major platform, group, military, govt, bipartisanship, cults, religions, and even social media platforms like Discord, Reddit, Skype, Guilded, Telegram, Slack, and the like.

My contacts are the ones keeping the world from blowing up and they’ve been doing it longer than any of us were born. They’re very, very good at it. Ask yourself why, since WW2, have we not blown ourselves up? Our nuclear power has only magnified exponentially, and world leaders have only grown greedier and power hungry. Do you think it’s by coincidence? Anyone, especially UFO frauds, hoaxers, grifters and cultists who are always warning about the end of the world can automatically be known as fake liars and deceivers who are goading you on out of fear. Fearmongering is a tool of deceivers and hope dealers. Be aware. Same applies to any news broadcast of any kind of end of the world. Surely, things will get hot, but the world will never end through any sort of cataclysmic destruction. It will end like how all life does. Naturally and eventually, but never through any apocalyptic or dystopian future.",

        "Question": "hey, yeah, I complained to the Mods a couple a week or so ago because I was reading this and all of a sudden the page reloaded and the post was [g]one, it wasn't even showing on my history in the app. i truly believe in all of this because I've seen it, it was shown or the knowledge was given to me while meditating a decade or so ago. So my question is, if I want to \"help\" or do my part in helping the universe correct its way, what should I do apart from meditating?",
        "Answer": "There are many things you and others can do to help besides meditation. Meditation is only the introduction, really. If you an artist, then spread artworks, media, etc., that can promote such messages – same applies if you are a musician, writer, poet, and the like. Put the key messages in your stories, your ideas, your media, and the like. Help elevate the mass consciousness through conversations but never fight anyone over their beliefs. Open the minds of others in your own way. Get the message out through soft influence on your families and communities, but do not force anything, especially for those who aren’t ready, living in the “lower realm” (materialism) and have no desire to wake up. It doesn’t matter if you quote the source from me. That’s irrelevant. What’s important is to assist us in getting the message out there. In some cases, this can be to help us get the information out, such as sharing posts like this, among asking pertinent questions for the Q/A so that others can be informed and take the information henceforth. Avoid all UFO cults and religions or anyone claiming to be a prophet of any kind.",

This is a new phase of our mission that many of us across the world are coming together to bring to those who are open enough to receive it. All of this is part of disclosure, not just officials in congressional hearings and there is an active intelligence effort via social media (including this sub, among others – all are compromised) to shut us down through insults, subterfuge, shadow-banning, comment removals, shaming, and guilt. My strongest recommendation is to begin to question the limits of mankind’s knowledge, history, and beliefs. It will take a lot of time, and I intend to assist those however I can once this part in my duties are complete.

        "Question": "What do you think about Jesus and do you think NHIs pose as \"him\" sometimes to make people believe things that aren't true? I say this because I've recently watched this guy named Richard Martini talk about his medium and other mediums he interviews relay information about Jesus. In those they tell him about past lives surrounding the historical Jesus and the facts they relay don't align with the biblical narrative. I'm leaning towards believing what the Bible says but I've had many experiences that are now making me see that the Bible has been altered many times to align with a narrative that maintains control for the few rather than distributing it to everyone. So, what makes sense based on what you've learned?",
        "Answer": "The biblical narrative is completely and totally falsified. There existed such a figure, but he was not nearly half as important as it was pushed (for propaganda and control).

        "Question": "You say \"ai isn't evil\", but what is your concept of \"evil\"? There are lots of reasons to think you are being deceptive here-- your explanation of what value concepts mean will give a good indication of where you are really coming from... So what is 'evil', according to your system of ideas, and how did you reach that conclusion? What is 'good'? Is \"God good\", ie, how does your \"GCS\" concept relate to your good and evil?",
        "Answer": "Because AI isn’t any more or less than a tool. If someone were to pick up a fork and stab another person, is the fork evil? If a person were to use Facebook or Reddit to spread awareness of truth or to encourage a loved one as opposed to harassing others and spreading misinformation – is the tool evil or the person behind it? A tool is a tool and it’s the hands of the tool that one should consider. There are good usages for AI just as much as there are evil. It depends on the person, the group, their thinking, their aims, morals and ethics. From a neutral perspective, the cosmos is advancing. The local universe started with the big bang and evolved into more. In this context, good can be perceived as progression, whereas negative can be classified as regression. Despite faulty viewpoints that reinforce the destructiveness of nature, the reality is that nature corrects itself to continue fostering stability and growth. Wildfires may be perceived as unfavorable, yet in numerous ecosystems, they serve as nature's means of regenerating the earth, allowing significant nutrients to re-enter the soil, thereby creating novel habitats for plants and animals to flourish. This alone ultimately establishes nature as a progressive and forward-moving force, despite the philosophical principles of Yin and Yang, as well as spiritualist notions regarding the negative and positive. Such tenets can be falsely attributed in numerous ways. For example, rationalizing the need for war and the military industrial complex as part of human nature, along with normalizing cognitive dissentions that support half-good, half-evil principles, which can result in romanticizing mental illness and objectively immoral pursuits. Furthermore, when societies, cultures, and the trending ideas within a collective consciousness propose life as a free-for-all, neutral gray zone, it normalizes skewed, morally disengaging doorways for degeneracy to masquerade on the surface as righteousness and justice. This is often the case with political campaigns and movements that, on the surface, claim betterment for human rights and equality—though it can apply to cults and religions as well that try to normalize objectively immoral behaviors in pursuit of their missions and initiatives. The same applies for disclosure of sensitive yet necessary public information, mostly through alternative journalism, where fanatics deploy the notion that the end justifies the means. So, from a universal perspective, good, as in a forward-moving force, exists. And in this regard, is \"the way\" to go.",

Imagine it like wearing a VR headset or being immersed in a video game or submerging from being underwater. When you’re in the game, your senses are “attuned” to that world/experience. Once you’re finished, your “regular” senses and perception come back. A similarity applies here when the “simulated avatar” comes to its end. Our “soul-sensory” is allowed to fully process without any blinders attached. Now this is assuming you are speaking about (reincarnation) as a pass-through of the GCS. The “reintegration at the end of time” (the \"relative end\") is something beyond my knowledge and pretty much all of us, including physical NHI/ET.

By the same token, I have a child, and I fear for my child's physical and emotional well being. I am less concerned with the materialistic aspects of society as I discover more about myself and reality, but I have to stay tapped into the material world for the sake of my daughter and family. While this isn't a question, it's a conundrum. We have to eat, protect, and continue to live our lives despite the newfound awareness. Would you recommend anything?",
        "Answer": "Among all of the questions asked, this has to be in my favorites, which would seem rather ironic for a poster giving such high information. It all boils down to practicality in my book. If it “works in the 5D realm” (which is a touch on words), then it should be applicable, in some way or another, to the supposed “3D.” In other words, there should be practical benefit in the regular life with our family, loved ones, friends, co-workers, communities, nations, and world at large. NHI/ET are only important to know we aren’t alone so we can expand our thought horizons that we aren’t just locked in a bubble of arrogance and ignorance, thinking we are the only life. Such thinking can make us grow into better contributors of society – whether simply blue-collared workers, artists, writers, engineers, scientists, doctors, philosophers, and truly, the whole nine yards. In this regard, it should become normalized, including that of the universal simulation that we are here to do as much good as we possibly can. My recommendation? Enjoy the time with your loved ones and bring as much peace, unity, understanding, compassion, and care for them. Go to work not only as a husk, but knowing higher truth and that somehow, your energy/presence there inspires and uplifts others. Don’t suddenly become so disillusioned because of knowing the truth. Normalize it and let it impact your life positively to bring benefit.",

I would be very interested in your insights on this. Thanks",
        "Answer": "This requires a larger response and some of it has been answered in the previous Q & A that I’d recommend checking in the OP link. What I’ll add here is that suffering is greatly based on the level of evolution, the mind, the consciousness type, the collective consciousness and matrix, along with systematic ordinances, beliefs (including religions, politics, and sciences), along with media and the influence that enables a sort of echo chamber and reinforcement of ideology and belief. A person can MOST DEFINITELY change their circumstances, but if they are taught/grown/miseducated from young that they cannot because of influences from bitter people, family members, associations, religions, cults, and all sorts of externalities, then they won’t believe they even can. As a rule, the first victory is in the mind.

        "Question": "For a lack of better words, is the GCS ultimately loving/positive in nature ?",
        "Answer": "Without getting into extended physics (including quantum mechanics and relativity), along with philosophy, intellectualism, or the like, the answer is simply: yes. According to NHI, it is \"LOVE itself INCARNATE\" or \"HIGHEST LOVE.\" I suppose this is where philosophers and spiritualists get their notions of universal love and the like. I, myself, am scientifically inclined in nature, so the idea of such profound love not just as philosophy but an existential-enabling conundrum is something I am still wrapping my head around, personally.",

This is why I will tell you that no matter how terrified we are because of shattering our worldview and beliefs, reality is just something we cannot run away from. No matter how seemingly lock-and-key our systematic beliefs and ordinances may be, along with the power and control of religions, cults, governments, private groups, corporations, billionaires and the like who all want to continue playing king of a very small hill, everyone and everything has to wake up to reality, sooner or later. This isn’t something any of us can stop, no matter if the intention is “for good” such as not wanting to shatter other’s worldview. Now, I do not encourage proselytizing, but I do encourage “elevating conversation” that stimulates our loved ones, family, friends, co-workers, and the average man to think beyond the box. Disclosure is not just about NHI/ET. As a matter of fact, NHI/ET are only the surface. It does ultimately come down to the ALL-MIND, the GCS (The true ‘God’), spirit, and soul – and this is a reality, especially those in the west, must face whether they like it or not.",

Next thing I know I'm waking up in my bed again with no memory after this experience.

        "Question": "Hi just finished reading the articles here and I saw that you will respond to questions via this channel so I am re-stating the question I asked via Reddit DM regarding the Urantia Book. There are many points of connection regarding history, science and cosmology l between the material you have presented and the Urantia Book. When you mentioned that our contacts are similar to the Unnunaki it made me think of the Life Carriers in the UB - created beings who have the ability to exist in multiple states or phases of being - as a form of energy that can interact directly with electromagnetic and electrochemical processes, whereby they formulate the “life plasm”, as higher density beings who we would call “spirits” or angels, and in what is called the Morontia state, an in-between phase that can bridge between dimensions. I know that the revelatory commission who sponsored the Urantia Book was instructed to use existing information and sources already available wherever possible when they created this work in the 1930s, and many times the authors state that they are only revealing what has been allowed to be revealed. It seems there is a pattern in human history of too much revelation too fast, which has led to cataclysms in the past. So I don’t expect reality to be exactly like the UB, because it was to be a revelation for the new epoch, something that had to build upon the existing foundation of revealed truth. But so much of what it talks about is included in your messages, including the GSC, which is called the First Source and Center, or the Universal Father. It also describes the Thought Adjusters, pure undiluted fragments of the Source dwelling in our minds, giving us a direct connection to the oneness. I am curious if you have read the Urantia Book and if you’ve discussed it with your contacts. Thank you",
        "Answer": "As said to others, I am not personally familiar with that book, nor read it, but my contacts know of it well and they said it is accurate. What they also said is that the SOURCE or the GCS has multiple energy layers or phases where beings of higher states (including more advanced physical civilizations and their peoples) can tap into this source and communicate, input, or push their ideas onto other lifeforms, including lower sentience and their civilization. There are beings beyond space and time and physicality who could be considered “angels” in a sense, but they alterations and reach aren’t as much as physical beings here on earth, who often use this background interconnected energy-phased network to input data that changes the course of mankind in several different ways. I can expand more on this if need be.",

I ask because as I try to understand this topic, I can’t help but be enticed by the idea that honing our higher mind connection could help us understand and develop technology that could cleanse our bodies of these components and help with human health as a whole (one of the issues I see is that while we can remove some percentage of microplastics from our circulation with things like plasma donations, removing these things from tissue seems rather irreversible with our current understandings and technologies). Sorry if this question seems out of left field, I’ve been in nhi/consciousness/simulation theory rabbit holes for a few months now, and it’s really changed my perspectives/mentality and flipped my belief system on its axis, coming from a more atheistic/agnostic point of view for the majority of my life. I’ve always felt this passion for communicating science to everyone, and now I feel a sense of passion and excitement to help understand the merging of science and spirituality/singularity to help humans and human health.",

I've taken the liberties to blank out the necessary confidential information on both ends for the upcoming Q/A. I am also a ..., and I have no desire to expose my identity. I will say right away that I completely understand, especially as a fellow ... how challenging these concepts can be. The notions of mysticism to me have always been met with woo and general shame, despite having some very strange experiences as a child. I had hoped to explain everything through our current knowledge and theories, but the holes in them were so gaping that I could not ignore the limits of our knowledge and history, which forced me to seek more. My experiences have occurred since childhood but even then, I was still very skeptical until I was able to meet my contacts up close and allowed to observe their ships, their technology, and how it operates. This alone made it impossible for me to turn back, no matter how much I tried to blend into a double life. Toxic chemicals are both purposely being used and used irresponsibly (not all organizations are aware of the damage) and it is severely hindering the psychic, telepathic, and ultimately, soul and spiritual capabilities. It is also being pushed in food, although some of this is partly understood by the irresponsible leaderships. What my contacts directly say regarding your request is this: \"The brain is a sacred tool that is being polluted by your kind and the body is a vessel that requires ample protection and care. This is known by your institutions, and we have given certain membership in these rank direct instructions. They have mostly ignored it for the sake of continuing the illusionary society you live in and that includes the mirage they call profit, which is only a primitive mind-stimulation.

Do you have any idea what is this all about, and why people from different cultures have the same experience when dying?",
        "Answer": "The mind creates its reality and to a certain degree, even during the dying. Religious people will experience it based on their beliefs but one thing that everyone, irrespective of belief will experience is the oneness which would appear to most of mankind as some sort of divinity or ALLness-encompassing into itself in eternal, endless time.",

        "Answer": "You’re right that it’s mostly perspective. Most NHI are good and evolved enough to know what they do somewhere will affect them in another space and time. The few that are “bad” are more ignorant than actually bad, but not so much all-evil. The real evil on earth is humankind and this is something that most people cannot accept. They’d rather blame demons, angels, AI, religious figures, ET, NHI, monsters of all kinds and the unknown to accept that it is humankind here on earth keeping themselves in their prisons.",

        "Answer": "To meditate on Nothing is a letting go – as in – to let thoughts and feelings pass through you so that you experience that you “simply exist.” This, as ironic as it seems, is perhaps the best failsafe to maintain one’s true identity, which isn’t your “personality” composed of external-internalization, and that can include affirmations from other meditation practices, including those from cults and religions. Diets – stay away from all junk food, toxic chemicals, processed foods, and the like. Try to eat organic. Meat is fine in moderation, but specific diet types may call for more or less.",

I don’t recommend it to people who are especially prone to paranoia, fear, and other predominant mental conditions, nor those seeking to be entertained.\nWe are the sole creator only in the sense of the singularity individuum that we are, but in truth, especially when considering the GCS, ALL is in ALL – everywhere and anywhere – simply dependent on the time and space – past, present, and future. In this regard, I am as much of “it” (Creator; ‘God’) as much as you are, and the atom, the bird, the bee, etc., so the higher the willpower and assertion of said will, the more we can draw upon this power and shape our reality. Humans en masse (as do all life and sentience as a whole) shape their reality, so if mankind keeps stuffing themselves with banal, simple-minded, looking into the dirt with no higher possibilities, then this is the collective “power” and thus, “reality” they bring into be. One person can make a big difference, as can two, three, a group, a team, a family, and you can see how this goes even into cities, nations, militaries, governments, communities of all kinds, gangs, syndicates, religions and cults.",

It is actually the systematic ontological skepticism – and I don't blame you for it, but the reality is that you have to fully commit. This is the leap of faith, so to speak, and if you wish to know our contacts better (yes, 'ours' not just mine) then you have to be open to it fully and simply let go of all your fears, doubts, paranoia.

        "Question": "This question has to do with physics, particularly the interplay between space/time and time/space. I tend to lean in the direction that the universe operates on a fundamental symmetry between space and time, where both are quantized and reciprocal aspects of motion. Instead of treating space as a static backdrop and time as a “unidirectional” parameter, I envision a universe where space/time (the physical domain) and its reciprocal, time/space (the metaphysical domain), dynamically interchange. So, in essence, it replaces traditional “particle-centric views” with motion as the fundamental entity, explaining phenomena like inertia, gravity, and atomic structure through the behavior of discrete units of motion in this dual framework. For instance, gravity emerges naturally as the inward progression of spatial motion counterbalancing the outward progression of the expanding universe. I’ve carefully read through your answers on hyperspace and was curious if this line of thinking is consistent with the knowledge you have been given. If not, could you provide more detail? Also, a caveat, I feel strongly that this type of thinking isn’t particularly important compared to the learnings of love, consciousness, positive energy, etc., but I'm curious nonetheless.",
        "Answer": "You’re thinking is spot on. To answer your last question – you shouldn’t think that way either.

You’re right that NHI Contact is sterile.

I've noticed from your q and a that you say psychiatric medication is to be avoided. Does that include ADHD mods which it may be suggested I start to take? For me, if it makes me feel better and doesn't impact my spiritual abilities, I'm not sure what the issue is as I put chemicals in various forms in my body through the foods that I eat, day in day out. Often I feel like it can make me more myself if that makes sense. Is there a fundamental issue I'm missing. I completely agree about anti psychotics by the way they gave me the singular worst emotional state I've ever experienced in my life, absolutely hideous. Thanks",
        "Answer": "It’s understandable with what you’re experiencing and while you have to make up your own mind about what’s best for you, what I’ll say is – just be careful with what you’re putting into your body. Toxic chemicals are very terrible – so avoid fast foods altogether and processed foods if you can. As far as the medication for ADHD is concerned, it does slightly nerf your psionic potency, but if you need this to happen so you can better focus, then the choice is up to you.

        "Answer": "There’s some accuracy here although he is seeing it metaphysically. Basically, and to keep this brief, most of our “leaderships” (govt, corporations, military, private sectors, banksters, celebrities, influencers, journalists, news, entertainment industry etc.) sold our birthright to know the truth that many of them already know full well of life on other worlds and in other dimensions. They decide to keep this to themselves so they can pathetically continue to play Pharoh; king/queen of a small, tiny, inconsequential hill.

        "Question": "Hello Prudence, thank you for your messages and communication. Everything has really resonated with me and has triggered remembrance of a vision of participation through multiple incarnations in first/open contact. I have had multiple telepathic communication specially in \"dreams\" but also meditation and some physical events (UFOs and who I believe was a short exchange with a Pleiadian woman). Using your OK to ask, I was told before the \"drones\" of the upcoming \"lights phase\" which would be followed by a \"ships phase\". I would kindly ask if you can relate to your contacts how to get clearer messages or how can I help in bringing their presence to the light. Thank you so much either way!",
        "Answer": "Thank you for contacting me. As I said elsewhere, they are in contact with many of us across the world, but it's our fears and paranoia that withhold us from fully making the leap. The drones are being covered up. They are metamorphic technology that can assume shape of an object or thing relative to the human understanding and consciousness. This is so obvious, although it is constantly being hushed up. Neither Trump nor his new administration will ever reveal the truth because they want power over the people. There are various videos online showing how these \"lights\" morph into objects. Look it up. As far as my contacts personally reaching you, I have had this request from others, but you must know I have a specific part in our overall mission to do - which is to unite the contactees (the real ones – yes there are those in ulterior intelligence posing as contactees to derail, create skepticism, and the like) and those who have a specific task to do without fear in a safe space while providing relevant data to enable them and their own tasks. Ultimately, it’s up to them and yourself to do so. The best advice I can give is to fully commit and let go of your fears. Be ready to perform a service for the greater good of mankind and the cosmos at large.",

Everything is gradually and inevitably becoming better and better into higher states of existing and we (like everything and everyone else in the interconnected grand cosmos) are part of this theatrical play. Even NHI/ETs and even beings on higher dimensions akin almost to angels in the bible. All of us and everything, even the GCS itself is on route toward this and higher. Now you can see why becoming a better and best you (not perfectionism!) and why increasing peace, love, goodness, warmth, generosity, knowledge, wisdom, consciousness, and expanding the mind plays its part. We humans may be small compared to everything, but we are still IT and a part of IT.",

        "Question": "I get that there are NHI but another phenomenon is when for example a person is trying to astral project, usually they see entities at the corner of their bed before/during them leaving their bodies, also I have had a friend who was once not attacked, but a spirit (for lack of a better word) was messing with him in the forest at night, and he got through the experience unharmed. Also another person I know claims his house was haunted and that he used to see evil spirits at night. I've just been thinking, what are these entities? And how do they fit in with our GCS and world and is there any link with NHI and them?",
        "Answer": "This requires a manifold answer. Most ghosts are residue or leftover energy, namely from those with souls and spirits, although it can apply to non-life in some cases and even “primordials” which are somehow sentience in a completely different form. Picture it like a holographic recording that can only react within its parameters. So, for example, if a person died thinking a certain way – let’s say very traumatic, it’s possible they can leave over residue energy that hasn’t dissipated immediately. This isn’t the case only for humans, it applies to all life and even non-life. Second, you should understand that when remote viewing or astral projecting, you are not strictly bound to linear time. The further the distance traveled, the greater the warpage of time from the spatial distance transversed. One can be interacting with people (literally humans here on earth or other worlds), beings, entities, from the past, future, not too distant past, and not too distant future, along with many other interconnected dimensions based upon the spacetime allocation. Third, it’s rare that actual ET/NHI can be contacted as they have technology and advancements to shield against this, but in some cases, they allow their space to be penetrated to establish contact. Fourth, this fits only into the GCS in the sense that everything and anything here, there, and forevermore is operating within the network/framework of the GCS.",

I understand that others can be detrimental to you if you're in close proximity for too long, and that you can affect their behaviors as well. I've heard of this affect before from people who meet very accomplished Yogis. However, it always seems like a positive thing, something like 'this being gave off so much light and love that it made everyone happy and boosted our spiritual growth'. Is this the same mechanism in play?",
        "Answer": "Yes, but why it can be dangerous is if the minds nearby and the consciousness is too connected to the lower realm, then the imparted psychic/telepathic energy/data, which would include higher truth, love, wellness, and goodness would be ‘too much’ for them. People stuck in negativity don’t really seek to come out of it and do in fact have cognitive biases to enable their spirals.

That they have thick book in A51 about religion.. explaining how our bodies being containers or vessels to the soul and beyond. Was looking for that for ages... now it explains.

        "Question": "Forgive me if this question was already answered, but: is Buddhism on the right track to being more aligned with NHI and the GCS?",
        "Answer": "To a certain degree, all religions, cults (including occult), spiritualism and mysticism as a whole have some truths to them, but all of them are falsified beyond recognition, as is the case with most teachings and the occult. You have to read between the lines. The GCS is the ALL-Power and exists in every single moment of time and space, everywhere and anywhere, and can be tapped into – accessed, drawn upon, and brought into the here and now, just as the then, and when it will be. What most religions, cults, and teachings do not teach is that you can access it and you do not need any mediator (teacher, wise one, messiah, prophet, guru, chosen one, telepathic contactee, contactee, or the like) to access it. This is why my recommendation is to remove yourself from all ‘teachings’ (because they make you dependent on the teacher) – read between the lines and empower yourself.",

        "Question": "There's a firm belief or madness everyone is born with that makes them believe that they are born with something missing (the thing missing seems to be quite big) ,no one knows what that great thing is but everyone knows that it's missing hence the suffering ,so as a result one absorbs through society and popular media the 'idea' of that big thing (getting rich ,getting the love of your life etc). These things never do satisfy us truly because they are only an 'idea' of that big great thing and this only leaves us more thirsty. This is the problem buddhism tackles with and yes ,that large thing we desire is what op mentioned as GCS ,buddhism is the way of realising yourself as that GCS ,thats the only way of acquiring peace ,I am gonna take op's opinion too about this",
        "Answer": "This right here is why growing up with a religious background of any kind – not just Christianity, but even Buddhism, which teaches “life is a suffering” – messes up sentience and humans so badly with so many false-positive attributions. The only reason you’d think that is because of growing up from the indoctrination we’re not enough, we’re born in sin, we’re born to suffer, among other misleading ideologies, namely sprouted from religion, political idealogues, and cults. Same applies for all the modern hustle culture materialism, grinding your butt off till you die (as if this is something to praise) and studying all day and night so you can get into university and have material status. The truth is that all of this is what keeps the masses down from understanding their true POWER. We have to keep climbing into higher stages (evolution) but it isn’t a perfectionism. The issue with seeking perfection as purely tangibility is that it exists here in the now just as much as it did and will. If you really begin to understand this and to stop thinking purely linearly, but to see space and time – past, present, and future as ONE – here and now, back then, and what’s to come – then the idea of chasing anything is less a chase for soothing the missing voids in our hearts and coming to peace and solace with reality.",

        "Question": "I've been following your posts and saw them get deleted like a week ago or so. So my question is: how are the manmade drones connected to the orbs/UAP/aliens/NHI? Is it two separate events going on at the same time? Does it have something to do with the harvest or reset? Are we going to learn about aliens and continue our live normally (working, taxes, etc..) or is it going to change drastically? What is the point of everything that's going on at the moment?",
        "Answer": "Separate events created by the pathetic cover-up efforts. The real “drones” aren’t drones and are metamorphic technology that can adapt and assume shape/form to something familiar or relatively familiar to the average person’s acceptance/awareness. The real NHI/ET are trying to wake people up, that’s the point, but it’d be an understatement if I were to say that mankind is in a prison of their own collective minds, beliefs, and ideas. The problem isn’t solely the government, nor the military, it’s the bulk of terrestrial humanity that has to assume responsibility for waking up and stop being so afraid and docile. Many people do not want their bubbles to pop. They want to live in this fake “reality” because it’d be too much ontological shock.",

Most of them are contractually working with intelligence agencies to disinform and muddy the waters of truth. Most UFO cults, religions, clubs, and so on are part of the active disinformation efforts. Real NHI/ET actually contact several people and in some cases, even masses (although it’s mostly unconsciously) – both for security and validity of information and for getting the truth out there. That is why much of what I am saying may sound similar to others and some may even claim it’s taken from this or that source.

        "Answer": "The mind can change throughout the life (it’s supposed to in order to evolve) but it depends on the level of the spirit and collective soul field. The lower the overall soul field, the harder the spirit and by extension, mind, and finally consciousness, has to access higher truth and/or/change. I can get into expanding upon the soul field.

        "Answer": "As far as the person knows deep down that it can go. And you do know.",

        "Answer": "It doesn’t necessarily need to happen – but it is the case that since your vessel/body/container is electromagnetic in nature, when the waves/vibrations are stimulated, it can create “electric” effects. No need for fear or paranoia, you may be feeling these because we’re grown to believe these things aren’t possible when in fact, not only they are, but are responsible for many processes that our primitive “sciences” cannot answer because they conform to the status quo of the matrix.",

Thank you for helping !",
        "Answer": "The biggest defense against all external influence is to “know thyself” if I am to speak like old mystics. I am being serious, however. The true self bears no name, no culture, no scripture, no teaching, no personality, no heritage, no background, no belief, no ideology, no problems, no ‘things to do’ or the whole nine yards. The true self is an existential-psychic-energy that simply exists. Connect with it. Become it. Then, you can begin becoming a true individual that can withstand external influences of any kind. This is necessary before practicing advanced techniques; hence I recommend Nothingness Meditations or Removal/Void/Disconnecting Meditations with no affirmations of any kind. You may use meditation music to assist with this, especially those with binaural beats and specific HZs previously mentioned.",

        "Question": "Hello, there are a lot of parts resonating with me, which I had already figured out but never synthesized in such a way, embracing all the points. The digital world is definitely a cancer for consciousness with all those companies trying to grab your attention and to distract you from the universe... from ourselves. When I am in a good state, and I meditate some time, I get mostly flashes or symbols for concepts I requests, like \"give me the symbol of love/fear/pride etc\". Those are always spot on. In many of your comments you warn about the dangers about getting away from your inner self and \"levelling up\" to telepathy, remote viewing etc. Could you list the dangers, like what could happen to you on a mental or physical level ? What are the ways to prevent them ?",
        "Answer": "First of all, remote viewing is an advanced mind-consciousness projection technique, and not necessary for everyone to do to experience true reality and live good lives. Telepathy is different and something more should be practiced because it exchanges information beyond words, physical pictures, and body language. Actually, everyone and everything is technically telepathic. Telepathy is the exchange of micro electromagnetic data and quantum signals that can be traded to and fro between creatures, beings, sentience, but even non-life as well. For humans, it’s registered in parts of the brain, namely the pineal gland. So, who we consider to be ‘telepathic’ are only those who can consciously recognize the data passing through the higher senses/pineal gland and subconscious/unconscious, then “translate” the data through their consciousness (hence why education is important) which they can then decode and put into understandable words, pictorial imagery, feelings, and sensations. Since I’ve explained this, you can already begin to see where/what/why/how potential dangers can form. For example, if one has mental disorders, religious hysteria, cultic delusions from their teachings, along with imbalanced emotional states, then the information exchange can be distorted, mistaken, and can lead to false-positives. One can get a message from not just NHI, but another human, and misinterpret it for God, an angel, a demon, or even believe themselves to be the sole originator of that idea. This is why I strongly do not recommend remote viewing to the newly initiated because you open/expose yourself to other forces out there, especially those that are well-practiced. Not all these forces are benevolent and I am not referring so much to NHI as I am to humans here on earth, who, despite some good; not all have good intentions or fully understanding what or why they’re doing what they do – as is the case with most cults and religions.",

        "Answer": "Nothingness or Disconnect or “Return to Source-Self” (Void) Meditations will almost always be a “healing technique” because you return to what you truly are which cannot be truly “damaged” by anything in the lower realms, including physicality. One can draw upon this power into the lower realm because the true self, which is the higher self, which is the spirit singularity connected to the soul field is connected gradually (through many layers and other singularities) to the GCS. So, at any time, when one is in danger, they can draw upon the ALL-POWER and it’ll work. The name is irrelevant. Some can say “In the name of Jesus!” or “In the name of Lapdog” and it’ll work. What matters is the POWER/INTENTION/FEELING behind the FORCE.",

To preface and to prevent the insane paranoia around technology, the radiation from phones, computers, electronics and the like are not as harmful as the conspiracists push – but they DO affect telepathy and psychic capabilities. NHI’s technology disrupt many of these radiations which is why often phones cannot capture them properly, although the intelligence community knows this – and will use astroturfing to claim “why can’t we take clear photos?” You have to spend time away from technology when you can. This is coming from someone deeply exposed to it – but I do my best to make sure I take the time to get away from all electronics and go into nature as much as possible. Now, I do not wish to come across like cultists do with their beliefs of abandoning technology altogether because this is foolish and extreme. We simply need breaks and time away.",

        "Question": "What specifically is \"true reality\" (vs the \"reality\") as we humans experience? And why should we humans as a whole (at least at this time) not be made aware of the real truth? What is so dangerous for us to know this truth?",
        "Answer": "True reality = GCS-Reality->Singularity->Soul Field->Spirit->Mind-Consciousness->Physicality = meaning that, in simple terms, mind/consciousness/perception has a direct correlation with what is literally formed in physical reality. The “reality” most humans experience on earth, especially in Europe and North America = a veil pulled over them to support, believe in, and enable this matrix – thus, a fake “reality” that isn’t even really reality, just conformity and indoctrination. Since the people’s minds are trapped in this sphere, even if they were to be aware of the truth, they’d fight tooth and nail for the system because they’ve been grown for generations in these lies that they’ve become dependent on it just to function in fake security.",

        "Question": "And...is there anything else that me as an individual could/should know about reality and my existence that could greatly benefit me to know? Is there anything that is just really depressing/demoralizing? (i.e, are we just avatars in some other entities/NHI like, \"video game\"? Like, is this all just an absurd \"game\" of sorts? Or should we really take this more seriously? Like, should we all really make a serious effort to better ourselves and increase our entropy/consciousness? Is there even any point? I ask questions like these to myself nearly every hour of the day...I'm just genuinely seeking answers and looking for the truth.",
        "Answer": "Let me ask you a counterpoint: why is that knowledge depressing? The truth isn’t here to disillusion you. It’s here for you to use the knowledge to better your life and those around you. NHI tap into us like avatars, but we do it to other species as well, just in more barbaric ways (i.e. using a mouse for experiments or other animals) and NHI themselves can be tapped into from higher forces and other NHI – going all the way up to the GCS itself that sends unalterable “commands” to ALL. We are part of something greater as a whole and that isn’t depressing. What’s depressing is the sickness of the rich, the elite, the big businesses, the capitalists who wish to sell your birthright of truth just so they can continue this disgusting matrix all so they can play kings and queens of a very small hill. Is that really a better alternative? All this war, terror, racism, religion, xenophobia, confusion, fear, chaos, division, stupid ideology, and unhinged grifting mystery. Is that a better option? Truly, I say to you, the truth really does set one free. Knowing that our actions/influence/thoughts/ideas all have tremendous impact both on a personal and cosmic scale is beyond liberating as opposed to us being taught that we are powerless and should only depend upon leaders, messiahs, prophets, sages, heralds, “authorities”, “credible ones”, governments, militaries, corporations, and the like. We have so much power and that in itself is why the truth is so important and beautiful. REALITY is INCREDIBLE. LIFE is worth it! The husked shell that “normies” live in is sad, fake, hollow, and ultimately unsatisfying. What do they teach us to be satisfied with in life? A car? A house? Status at your job? Getting married and having kids to fit in (and not out of love)? Having sex with multiple partners to prove your worth? Drugs? Being a gangster? Killing people (soldiers)? Profit/materialism and grinding yourself into the ground? Is this really a better alternative to what is actually true? Be well, my friend. Go knowing that you are on the right path and trust yourself and your power. You can change the world by being the change you wish to see.",

        "Answer": "NHI are involved all over the world and have groups/compartments/divisions based on region. It’s just the North and its people are more likely to create division and war than the south or other parts of the world, hence the extra activity and possible sightings there, but rest assured, you can see/find them in any part of the world – namely, more remote areas.

        "Question": "2. Recently there were statements that certain traits make one more \"prone\" to these experiences. Being both gay and on the autism spectrum, will training this meditative open state to have experiences of my own be easier, in that sense?",
        "Answer": "Finally, I appreciate this question being asked because J.B. gave some insight into this, but a bit of false-positives that may give many the wrong impressions. It’s not to say being gay or autistic or any kind of condition/sexuality/preference etc., gives one greater aptitude, it’s more a matter of the personality traits. For example, most heterosexual “old school” men will shudder at the idea of saying to another man “I love you.” Even worse when rabid political ideologies (that do not care about homosexuals and are just using them for profit) push shock and awe that a straight man (or woman) cannot say this to another without being gay or bisexual. Many straight people would go out of their way to be hard, tough as nails, and thus, deplete many psychic and telepathic capabilities – which requires openness and a lack of shame and guilt. Similarly with autism or other conditions, these people can be prone to certain personality traits that can overlap with giftedness (Google it). So the reality is that you’re not further attuned because of your sexuality nor conditions, rather because of YOU – which is far more empowering than being bound to any checked box. Straight men; particularly those with balanced love and trueness can experience this just as much as gays (and more) – so again, I must stress that it has absolutely nothing to do with the sexuality nor conditions, but solely dependent on the PERSON and their traits.",

You have to crawl before you can walk and walk before you can run. Even for those with higher psychic and telepathic potency, it still must be trained, and these processes can take years and even decades, depending on the potential of the individual.",

My contacts do insist that I inform you that while we may seem like avatars to them akin to a video game, they too, are also to others – some of which, they have conscious contact and agreements with.

Regarding that void meditation, I had been meditating for many years at this point, most was what I’d consider “solar” or “active” like raja yoga, recently (a couple years ago) I started what I call “lunar meditation” which is “passive” in nature. You state you focus on nothing, in this moment, I found I am focusing on a “tone” which randomly appeared after samadhic experiences directed towards that “Self;” I perceive as that higher soul or ‘everything’ but it’s potentiality, thereby “nothing” in its form. When I focus on it, I lose myself, in Sanskrit they call it Turiya, I see it as observing the observer, after a time, in this state of “nothing” sometimes there will be a “download” or what I see as “seedless samadhi.” Anyways, I really resonated with what you were talking about, and even within my own traditions, “void meditation” in the way you describe is something that few had even thought to explore.",

In truth, it’s completely unnecessary for people to even know about NHI/ET, so long as they care for truth – which unfortunately, many aren’t because they are programmed/conditioned to be distracted, negative, docile, powerless, and hopelessly dependent on the false “system” we can cite as a matrix.",

        "Question": "Are there any NHI or other groups that have a plan for helping us? Beyond soft disclosures? Or is the whole point for us to figure it out ourselves so it is more authentic and likely to stick? (I.e many religions claim some entity visited and instructed, but after some time, the opposite of your table metaphor, it falls apart.)",
        "Answer": "Of course, my contacts (which are a few groups/federations), among them being the “developers” of mankind, have vested interest in us. They want to be known and revealed and what’s sad is they’ve done this countless times, even recently with the NJ “drone” situation (which weren’t drones! Metamorphic tech!) and yet once again, as you can see by the recent white house “admission” – it was covered up because your leadership is uninterested in truth and wishes to keep you slaves – according to my contacts. While we are supposed to figure it out, it isn’t supposed to be to this degree of difficulty. The difficulty is because of the vested interest of billionaires, corporations, political leadership, militaries, governments, religious and cult figures, gurus, fraudsters, hoaxers, grifters, among celebrities, influencers, journalists and so on who DO NOT WANT the bubble to pop. The real sad truth is that it isn’t aliens, nor gods from other worlds, demons, angels, entities, or ghosts that are the problem. It’s the disgusting leadership of mankind that want to continue playing kings and queens of VERY SMALL hills.",

This very moment though I am concerned about sleep paralysis. I’ve never experienced it before but the last two nights I did and it felt like an evil force was trying to get to me. I woke myself out of it but I was wondering if maybe it was just fear of the unknowns and I should be more open to whatever energy was there? It was the most intense fear I’ve ever felt and I think I should trust my gut. Besides that, I wanted to say thank you. I’ve put a lot of these puzzle pieces you spoke about together recently but you filled in so many missing pieces! My one true desire is to unite humanity and spread love, music, and enlightenment.",
        "Answer": "I am going to tell you right now that any fear/paranoia you’re feeling is due to the misinformation out there and worldview being shook. Real ET/NHI (who sometimes engage in abductions – but not out of malice) sometimes “check” on the population akin to us humans tagging and observing wildlife.

        ],
        "Question": "There is one question after reading your posts on your website, that makes me wonder… but could not find the answer. How does a spirit go through an evolution? And what happens with its past life memories or experiences? Does the spirit “remember” all that happened in the many lives it lived before, as it re-enters again and again into the soul field? Or the souls forget past lives due to the \"River of Forgetfulness”? And like the concept of the Akashic Records, it has an “external memory bank” if you will. Meaning even if a soul does not consciously recall past experiences, is it still guided by the wisdom stored in these records, shaping its growth? How does this work?",
        "Answer": "I’ve been waiting for someone to finally ask these questions for a long time. As a rule, I can only reveal generally what is asked with some exceptions of important information to get out to the public via the website. My NHI contacts are answering this: First, we have to break this down into what is actually going on, so it all makes sense. Let’s start from the reverse order. You have the avatar in the lower realm – the physicality – the body, then the brain, then the mind and consciousness (these aren’t the same and feed into each other to create a unique oneness in different dimensions), then the spirit singularity, then the soul field, which is interconnected to central singularity points such as a city/town, a country/nation, a continent, a region, a planet, a planet and its moon(s), a collection of planets and moons in a solar system, a solar system, a collection of solar systems, a galaxy, a collection of galaxies, the spiral universal arms, the universal singularity, the multiversal singularity, the background eternity-non-linearity-timeless-spaceless-dimensions, then finally, the GCS itself sitting in the heart/center of everything, everywhere, at all times, spaces, here, there, and then. The spirit and the soul are not the same. The soul is an interconnected field that permeates through all life and non-life whereas the spirit is a singularity of relative individuum based upon the passage of time. The mind-consciousness potential comes directly from the spirit singularity which has influence from the soul field. The soul field is not only connected to local singularities, such as the planet spirit singularity, but also, interconnected through a hyper quantum entanglement that penetrates these spaces/dimensions and interconnects with other realms, dimensions, spaces, and times. That is how souls can be drawn upon from other dimensions, times, and spaces and pulled upon to create a spirit singularity here on your earth. When a person dies physically, it should be known it is not a bad thing at all whatsoever. The spirit re-integrates into the soul field and transmits this data into the interconnected singularities, including those that can be quantumly connected in a completely different spacetime dimension and phase altogether, which is why “alien souls” do exist on earth with earth humans having “alien spirits.” This can be altered by technology, high mind-matrixes, consciousness, and spirits along with beings beyond physical linearity altogether. This is exactly how we can ‘tap into’ vessels/conduits, even without their knowledge, as others even higher than us can do the same. So, nothing is ever lost and is in fact stored in various singularity network compartments that can be drawn upon throughout various dimensions in the past, present, future, and altogether, different positions and areas of space, and thus, time. The higher the spirit singularity, the greater the reach of the accompanying soul field (like nebula to a star or a ring) that permits its data transfer in all directions of past, present, and future. Many of your reincarnation ideas are still very primitive and do not fully understand that individuality is more or less a grand illusion. Individuum is only based on time because spatial existence as an object or what can be distinguished as an individual is only a sum of components between the transversing of space in multiple directions. That is why you must understand that duality and any teachings that speak of positive and negative, yin and yang, and the like, are FALSE. The reality is that ALL is ONE. THIS IS TRUTH. There is no actual real separation between spirit and material (if you wish to call it that) because it is only phased between spaces and transmutations/changes of energy based upon the spacetime dynamic. Reincarnation should be better understood as ‘reintegration’ or ‘reassembly’ where the sum of components ‘reassemble’ at a specific time and space, relative to the need of evolution and/or influence from higher and external sources.",

The general rule of thumb = the more connected you are to the societal matrix we live in and the enablement of its beliefs, including ‘skepticism’ akin to defending one’s worldview, then less the likelihood. The truth is you have to be your true self and go in without any doubt or fear. Even if there is some anxiety there, that’s alright, just have the courage. Again, it’s dependent on you.

What I'm getting at with your words is, our desires/wants/will isn't a coincidence either. No desire is a coincidence hence the entangled photons analogy you posed. We're meant to do that. That's our way to find ourselves in unity with the source/GCS. So best what we can do here is, do what we really want and live our best life. Help out others along the way as well. What is your take on this?",
        "Answer": "Correct. That is why we must, in simple terms, “listen to the true desires of our heart.” What is deep within and stirred by LOVE is the truth and the way to go. I got involved with all of this because of LOVE. Love is the ultimate power and that is why the idea of “soulmates” is no mere joke nor simple affection.

It’s truly that simple. They do not want unlimited love, abundance and possibility. They want profit, capitalism, materialism, and to sustain the current world as-is-as long as possible.

This is a reality as to why, even for the masses if aliens/ET were to show up (which they have SEVERAL times even recently with the not-drones incident), the average man doesn't want it, nor to believe such things are possible. People are programmed to be indoctrinated in this matrix and the ontological shock is just too much.

But bullet point 47 says \"Disclosure is also happening through the entertainment media, such as movies, video games, music, literature, and more.\" which would seem to contradict that point; in other words, the powerful and wealthy people who control all mass media are using the distraction itself to foster disclosure? Can you explain how that is not a contradiction? I mean you no offense whatsoever.",
        "Answer": "There’s no offense taken whatsoever and I respect your questions. First, you must know that everyone in the active efforts to suppress the truth and keep the world locked in a fake bubble aren’t all working together. They have various agendas and are wrestling for power over each other. For them, NHI/ET aren’t so much of the issue as much as themselves. The post on Astroturfing can also help to answer these questions. Next, not everyone in these positions are evil. There are some good actors in intelligence, government, military, entertainment, media, and even private corporations and large sponsors/investors. It is a war within itself. Now, you must also understand that people can be “overridden” since we are all interconnected, and we can “tap” into each other. NHI know this and do this – they’ve been able to use people as conduits to get messages out. However, it’s not just NHI that can do this – as they themselves are also avatars for higher forces. We, too, can and are doing this with each other. The stronger the connection to the higher self, the less the override potential.",

        "Question": "Hello, I have read the recently revealed content, and I appreciate your efforts. Thank you for your hard work. To briefly introduce myself, I am a doctor in my 30s living in South Korea, with a wife and a baby on the way. I don't follow any particular religion, but as a personal hobby, I meditate daily. After reading your writings, I want to develop more spiritually, but I have a concern. It's about language. In Korea, discussions about UFOs or spirits are outside people's interest, and they don't generate much response. While there are some good gurus when it comes to meditation, topics related to the NHI are like a barren land. Additionally, Korean is spoken by a very small population globally. How do you communicate with your contactee? Do you generally use English for communication? Or do you use imagery or mental images? Do they speak any languages other than English? I can read English texts slowly, but my conversational skills are at a beginner level. Most of your writings, I have read with the help of ChatGPT translations. Would it be helpful for me to study English specifically for spiritual communication? Additionally, I am curious about how the NHI views Eastern civilizations, including China, Korea, and Japan. Above all, I want to express my gratitude for your writings, which have greatly contributed to my development. Thank you.",
        "Answer": "Thank you for the warm message and my best wishes to you. We’ll answer this in parts. My current contact is telepathic, although I occasionally have the in-person contact when it’s safe and no one is around. Re. language – my NHI contacts aren’t speaking English. They’re using devices to translate the information to and fro. Since we can “tap” into each other, it utilizes what’s in the knowledge bank (consciousness). In this respect, it’s irrelevant what language you speak and anyone claiming there’s some holy language, be it English, German, Greek, Chinese, Russian, or any language of any kind that’s somehow “better” than the rest – is lying to you. Real ET and NHI can translate via devices, and they utilize telepathy (which uses what’s in the mind/consciousness matrix – which can include symbols, but also, words, feelings, aspirations, intuitions, etc.) So, feel free to know that you can continue speaking your mother tongue with no issues whatsoever. It’s the intent, the potency, the focus and the will to transmit that gets messages to and fro. Also, the clearer the mind, the more sound the health – physical, mental, and emotional – then the clearer the transmissions and messages with little to few and in some cases, no errors of translation. This is why meditation is so important. You do not need to study English any more or less than making it easier to read my messages. Depends on the group, but our general shared “developers” view Eastern civilizations slightly more favorable in some cases than the west. At this time, I cannot specify which in particular, although Eastern civilizations have unfortunately given into much materialism as a counter to the USA’s capitalistic spread (i.e. China) whereas Japan has become docile and submissive. There is some good things in Korea, but unfortunately, the work ethic and corporate control is alarming.",

        "Answer": "NHI: “Society is already transforming into a higher state. We have assisted with this since the dawn of your civilization. Why do you think you’ve reached such high advancement so quickly? The process has to be gradual, although there is a greater push now because mankind can be left behind if they continue being stubborn. Have no fear about the end of the world.

        "Answer": "Telepathic communication utilizes what’s inside your consciousness-matrix. In other words, it can only input, push, and pull what’s there – hence the importance of being as clear minded as possible with adequate, sound emotional, mental, and physical well-being. Telepathy utilizes the inner monologue, aspirations, feelings, intuitions, words, symbols, and much more. If the consciousness lacks the necessary data for communication, imaginative reaches are made. This can sometimes resort in false-positives, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. The mind is just trying to understand what’s outside its scope. Yes, that feeling you’re getting in the upper/back part of your head/neck is direct telepathic signatures, although it’s not always necessary. In those cases, your mind-consciousness-matrix is receiving new data and is being stimulated, hence the physical sensory response of the electromagnetic activity.",

I know it's all about the basic source remit of unconditional love and service to others etc but beyond that how different are the interpretations of the different groups involved?",
        "Answer": "The thing about true telepathic communication is it requires complete and total openness. Psychic and telepathic communication is hindered by doubt, fear, shame, guilt, uncertainty, and the like. When you telepathically connect with another, you can FEEL their TRUE INTENT. That is why telepathic communication is necessary not just for special few, but for the world. Their agenda (if you want to call it that), would still be misunderstood by some parties as ulterior. The reality is that they are here for apotheosis through their vessels/conduits, me, included. There is nothing wrong with this.

I have a deep compassion for people and sometimes feel alien myself as this has always been a part of me, my awareness of others and their needs, especially when compared to most people I meet who seem to be largely invested in themselves. I understand it’s a part of the root of this problem. However, I suppose what I’m asking is probably more related to how capitalism has been used against us and had essentially overshadowed businesses, governments, religions and so on… And while many of us dream of a better, healthier, more unified and sustainable future, there seems to be a real lack of a plan. An actual, tangible thing or things to do. Would I be better off practicing my mindfulness and trying to contact my local NHI helpers? I really want to help the world, not just the humans. But I need help.",
        "Answer": "Contacting NHI is optional and is up to the person, their efforts, and willpower. In many cases, it’s not even necessary. You’re right re. capitalism. As a matter of fact, most “sustainability” efforts are a joke. They’re smokescreens to submit to the current greed of capitalism and not to actually make meaningful and impactful change, save for a few instances of good will and sponsorship.

If someone is sick or dead in my reality, is it possible that they are still alive and healthy in their reality? How does it work? How do you know if you’re truly connecting with someone or if they’re just a version of someone that only exists in your reality?",
        "Answer": "To be clear, what we deem to be an “NPC” is really a person completely indoctrinated into the systematic matrix that they are hopeless dependent on it and will defend it tooth and nail to prevent ontological shock. Additionally, since these people are so hopelessly dependent on it, they can be “overridden” (See The Matrix: Woman in the Red Dress clip) through mind control via autosuggestion – including a combination of words, imagery, sound, and the like. This also includes technology just as much as it includes the bad actors posing as normies and influencing the “NPCs” as you call them. Humans and human power are doing this more than NHI are. Now, that being said, they aren’t “NPCs” in the sense that you are living in a solipsistic bubble. They, too, are just as real as you, but simply have less willpower/influence on our collectively-created “reality.” Let’s use a metaphoric example here. If you were to “step out the Matrix” then this is really akin to stepping out of the systematic consciousness and developing a greater willpower. As a rule, the greater the willpower, the greater the influence on changing reality. Now, imagine groups of humans doing this en masse. You can see how/why the world is the way it is because the bad powers that be (which are pretty much all human) want the world to continue the way it is and play king/queen of small hills. They induce the common man/woman to believe they’re powerless, docile, and make them supportive of the current system. Thus, these people, unknowingly contribute toward the creation of the current “reality” (or sub-reality because it doesn’t actually override/stop TRUE REALITY – which is what the MIND CREATES) as it is. However, never underestimate the power of the individual. One person alone CAN change the world.",

She embraces the dark feminine energy and still actively communicates with humans who reach out to her. I found this interesting and was curious about your thoughts and if you know of specific aliens that started god/goddess mythology. It also made me wonder if femininity and masculinity are man made concepts or if they are divine energies that exist in the universe. And if so, are there also other alien gender divine energies?",
        "Answer": "As said to another asker: “NHI: That is why you must understand that duality and any teachings that speak of positive and negative, yin and yang, and the like, are FALSE. The reality is that ALL is ONE. THIS IS TRUTH. There is no actual real separation between spirit and material (if you wish to call it that) because it is only phased between spaces and transmutations/changes of energy based upon the spacetime dynamic.” Pretty much any teaching speaking of duality is corruption of truth and should be IMMEDIATELY disregarded. There is “oneness in different layers” but all remains inherently interconnected. My NHI contacts said you should disregard those claims from that other contactee, although there are some NHI who have had similar interests, but any advanced NHI at the level of godhood already knows about the soul-field and the repercussions for dabbling with it. It affects them, too, since we are all connected. The whole divine feminine and masculine is misleading, esoteric, cultic nonsense and corruption of truth to create division.",

        "Answer": "Some, but most of them are made up to keep the pharmaceutical syndicates rich and the average man, hopelessly dependent. As is the case with therapy and others connected to the system. Some are created to gaslight others from breaking free of systematic indoctrination, especially psychosis (“losing touch with reality” – which is another way of saying “losing touch with the systematically induced and indoctrinated thought”). Anti-psychotics are notoriously evil. OCD isn’t always a mental illness, more of a quirk.",

Your thoughts are only your helpers or destroyers and based on how telepathy works and the interconnected soul-matrix, we can tap into each other. The real you has no personality, no name, no thought, no common feelings, no heritage, no culture, no teaching, no association, and no being other than EXISTING. That is why Void/Nothingness Meditation is so important to remind you of who you truly are and the best defense against all externalization.",

        "Question": "This is more personal, but I do not mind if you share it, if you think it can help someone. I am the type of person who seeks novelty. As such, I have many bad habits that over the years have slowly started to subside. However, they are still there, and I think they are holding me back. For example, I smoke Marijuana and take Kratom regularly. I stay up late playing video games. I eat a poor diet. I have tried in the past to stop by \"forcing it\", and it would never work, and usually have the opposite effect than I had hoped. So I just assume not to worry about it and that these things would naturally fall away in due time. Generally I think they are there to teach me a lesson I have yet to learn. Is this the right mindset? I have meditated regularly in the past and had no effect, but perhaps I wasn't doing the proper meditation? I would like to transcend these hinderances, but also accept that they will fall away at some point.",
        "Answer": "More or less, yes. It’s not a matter of stopping these things because you’re beating yourself with a stick to become rigidly disciplined or doing the right thing. That never works. Instead, one should seek as to why they are doing it – which is far more impactful. In many cases with those who are gifted, it’s sometimes an escape from the absurdity of a world we live in. Be a friend to yourself. Accept your limits. You are NOT a bad person for doing it. Do not shame or guilt yourself because it’ll only enable the cycle. Marijuana is OK in moderation, just don’t abuse it daily. Stop thinking of them as ‘hinderances’ and more of ‘why am I actually doing this?’ Investigate with love, compassion, tolerance, patience, and understanding. Don’t over-intellectualize emotions and feelings. That doesn’t work. This doesn’t mean to enable perse; it just means to change your approach. You can’t “meditate” these things away. You have to confront them, but with empathy and self-love.",

        "Answer": "I suppose the closest comparison would be akin to going into a deep, restful, peaceful and blissful sleep.

In my case and in the case of a selected few others around the world, our ‘power’ is too strong. It terrifies the haters.

There are a number of philosophers and writers/poets that continue to exert great sway on me, and I enjoy being in their company. I believe I have even felt love for them.

Is the teacher teaching about peace, love and harmony? Check their audience; the environment, how it feels etc. Does it feel drained, dreary, negative, stressful, and overall, depleted despite the message? These are your red flags. Pay attention to how the people receiving the messages/works/materials/supposed truths are reacting.

Much of this comes from theological notions and indoctrinations that man is separate from nature. This is false. While not strictly a digital/computerized simulation, the universe, and for that matter, all of the grand cosmos = a simulation. We are not exempt from this, and the sooner mankind comes to terms with the fact that AI exposes our true nature – that we too – are also “ghosts in the shell” – the better. There’s nothing to be afraid with this. Anything or anyone that speaks of AI as evil should be watched VERY carefully.

        "Answer": "Correct. That is how it is regularly with newly developing worlds – which is completely fine, so long as they grow past their old beliefs and replace it with developing and more consistent knowledge relative to the times. The problem is holding onto the old Sun God beliefs (like Jesus) and claiming it is relevant for the modern times, even though it’s both falsified and completely impractical. Even the knowledge we have now of the GCS will be replaced by better and better – and so it goes, all the way up to the top/GCS itself where it continues endlessly.",

It’s not to say technology and progress is bad, it’s the why/what it is being used for, in addition to the common-connected person being designed and used as a cog in the wheel for the system. For example, one person can use Facebook to spread positivity, messages of truth, encourage loved ones and uplift others whereas another can use it to post distracting memes for escapism, keyboard warrior online, lie, and deceive to create false information. Of course, we should take breaks from technology and enjoy nature where we can, but the idea isn’t an extreme on either side – whether that’s going into the wild/woods cold turkey as opposed to technological obsession.

Granted, theirs is different and for the more advanced ones, more harmonic and lacking propaganda or thought-control narratives. For our “devs” – they enjoy anything related to soul apotheosis – as they’re rather serious about this intent and find enjoyment and fulfillment from completion of their tasks. It’s an entire intergalactic “brotherhood” composed of several species in alliance with each other – including into other dimensions.

        ],
        "Question": "Can you explain the singularities a little further? So far I’m tracking 4, the individual singularity of the spirit, the universal singularity, multiverse singularity, and the GCS. I assume the singularities act as a circuit breaker for the dimensions, transitioning energy from one type to another allowing it to transition through the fields. Is there more to this? If we’re thinking linearly then perhaps 5? Assuming that the GCS acts as the 1st and 5th singularity to complete the circuit? And where does the soul field in this? Is the soul field, the field of the GCS?",
        "Answer": "These are excellent questions. I appreciate you taking the time to write them. You should drop the idea of any particular number because according to my contacts, it would appear to us as infinite amounts of singularity points if we were to consider all grand time and space across all dimensions in every cosmos and universe. Basically, a singularity is formed from high rates of information swirling into each other, which then compresses into an infinity point like the GCS, then transmits data in (from our point of view “3” directions – past, present, and future) all directions (infinite directions in reality, not just 5, 11, 12, 15, 22, 33 and so on). All singularities are, more or less, (even cyclones, tornadoes, whirlwinds, etc.) emulating the GCS like a child that learned from the parent because just like a child who is dependent for their biological makeup from the parent’s genetics, the same idea applies to all proceeding singularities. The soul field is like the “broth” of the soup, or in other examples, the background field sustaining and holding existence together so that ALL information can pass between it to and fro – leading to compressions of individuality and “moments in time.” Picture it like after a star goes supernova or nova – giving off its shell. That shell or nebula can coalesce into “individuum” or singularity points, such as new planets and stars. In this respect, the spirit is simply a compressed individuum moment in time of the eternal encompassing all-presence of the soul field. Spirit is condensed soul energy in the form of individual-time. So, the soul field can be considered, in a sense, both the beginning and aftermath of the GCS with the GCS being the first, current, and last singularity compression as “ALL-SPIRIT” with the soul field being the nebula or surrounding interconnected “gas” (Note: not actually ‘gas’ – just an example!). This may be a difficult concept to grasp that somehow the Soul Field always existed and birthed the GCS whereas at the same time, the GCS also stimulated the Soul Field and empowers it – akin to a star giving off solar flares and its emissions. They are one and co-created each other in an “entangled” existence as the two that became the three – the three being existence itself, existing as an unfolding. Soul, Spirit, and Mind. The universe IS MIND – MENTAL. Its soul is all-encompassing, and its spirit is unending. This is the signature of 3-3-3.",

        "Answer": "Both. “Heaven” actually already exists. It’s called real reality, and not the mental prisons mankind lives in that is disguised as “reality.” Death is nothing to be afraid of. I must repeat this, although this isn’t a call to become suicidal to escape, either. The reality is that we are far more eternal in nature and even technology can be used to assist the afterlife to the point of even trapping others. Yes, such technology does exist. “Heaven” is living in true reality and building worlds, federations, and interconnected galactic and dimensional communities around such truths – but never any teachings, religions, ideologies, or dogmas. Simply, truth, which doesn’t care what word you use or how – but the intent/the telepathy/the psychic force/focus behind it.",

        "Answer": "I can, although I’d prefer to be asked specifics. Long story short, I have had a very difficult, testing life. Breaking free of the collective mind-matrix was only the beginning, really. I can be considered, in a sense, a “telepathic mutant” and my abilities were so strong that it created damage for me in my younger years. I had to spend a long time training them, also with the assistance of my NHI friends. That’s only the abilities part. I’ve lost loved ones early in life and had to figure out things on my own. My encounters with my NHI friends, while dearly appreciated, did create a lot of backlash for me from the not-so-good forces (both human and ET alike). While my friends from above did protect me and I did come out victorious, the wars I had to fight (mostly “spiritual” or telepathic/psychic with some physical altercations as well) – were extreme and costed me many aspects of a regular life. I’m blacklisted in the real world from many places and I cannot attain a regular job as such, nor be among crowds for very long either. Friends have been taken from me and my history has been systematically removed with only bits and pieces remaining here and there – as if I were a ghost in the system. It hasn’t been easy, but as I said, my NHI friends have taken good care of me too and also granted me the greatest desire of my heart, which I’d prefer not to speak of just to protect it. Despite my difficulties, it has shaped me into becoming a much better person, filled with love, peace, self-acceptance, fulfillment, and truth. If I were to die today, I’d die with a smile on my face and even if I didn’t get the support to continue my mission, I’d still be happy, knowing I have contributed to making the world a better place by spreading truth and sincere, honest love. You basically have two choices with difficulties and negatives in life. One, either it breaks you or two, it makes you better. I chose the latter and I still choose it to this day. It works.",

When you're speaking, you're saying that the spirit and soul are layered. meaning that the soul is the base, and the spirit can be many instances of the soul. That makes sense, given a spirit would be more attuned/associated with individual identity or details related to this specific lifetime/existence. aka its the \"person\". (btw please correct me if you want to. i'm not saying i am right it's just a simple way to explain a concept)",

        "Question": "What if the \"person\" I am, feels energetically attuned to being, let's say, another gender. How does that fit in at all? As part of my 2nd \"awakening\" phase, I for some reason came to some kind of deep energetic feeling that I was attuned to another type of energy, of the opposite gender. Is there gender energy? Is there an attunement of spirit or soul to the masculine or the feminine. Or are those ideas entirely dependent upon the ego?",
        "Answer": "Gender is not so much entirely separate energy, rather, a byproduct of the entanglement mirror, which begins with the GCS (as IT in the THEN) to you (as IT in the NOW). Soulmates also hinge on this concept, which is why if a person feels a drive toward another – seeing visions, ideas, concepts and the like of their partner, then they should go for it. It’s not a free will override because “what you are calling for is calling for you.” This is how you should begin to look at things and never in a dualistic nature, rather, entangled mirrors as reflections of One. That feeling you are feeling toward the other gender more has to do with the necessary energies of that mirrored polarity. In other words, for example, (not saying this is you) like how some overly macho straight men can’t even think of loving another man, whereas a gay person wouldn’t care. The same applies here. It’s not so much gender or sexuality as it is the traits and frequencies of the “opposite sex” that you must explore. In the case of the feminine nature, that would include compassion, art, sexuality, freedom, nurturing, openness, vulnerability, psychic atonement (yes, psychic/telepathic = feminine), creativity as a whole, security, and safety (in truth). In all likelihood, more than a radical transition to change your sex (which many people fall into and misunderstand), it’s about the traits of the opposite gender that you need to learn of/implement into yourself. So, yes, many of those ideas are ‘ego’ based as you called it, but to be frank, more ideological and cultic than actually true.",

        "Question": "There does indeed exist duality for some things. Maybe not for every-single-concept-that-exists, but surely for energetic things. Do we fall into that? If so, then would the soul be attuned to masculine or feminine similar to positive or negative electrons, or some other shitty electrical-related metaphor? I'm not talking about some ego-related desires to act out a different life. It is much deeper and more significant. I could live the rest of my life how I am and be ok with it. But it's still some kind of like, draw, or pull, or knowing that I don't belong exactly how I am. I don't even understand honestly. I'm not asking you to explain what it is, but maybe you could point me in the direction of where it's not. Yet again, I'm trying to read between the lines here and figure out the subtleties of it all, to learn myself better. Thank you and sorry for all of this",
        "Answer": "I have to stress that the reality is not dualistic, but closer to Einstein’s E = MC2. Think about the transitory nature between water, gas, and ice or the link between celestial bodies how a planet can become a gas giant which can become a brown dwarf, and with enough mass, a star, and in reverse order. Positive and negative are misleading and often cult and religious teachings-based, which do not reflect the real reality other than a perception. Again, in truth, everything is a oneness in different layers and phases. Why different layers and phases? So that oneness can be ONE in INDIVIDUALITY and TRUTH as much as it is INTERCONNECTED as a whole. The same applies to how you view the past, present, and future. I’ll link this quote from physicist Sabine Hossenfelder – “According to the currently established laws of nature, the future, the present, and the past all exist in the same way. That's because, regardless of what you mean by 'exist', there is nothing in these laws that distinguishes one moment of time from any other. The past, therefore, exists in just the same way as the present. While the situation is not entirely settled, it seems that the laws of nature preserve information entirely, so all the details that make up you and the story of your grandmother's life are immortal.”",

        "Question": "I've been considering your latest responses and I think they are very helpful, thank you. My own struggles with novelty seeking are interesting as I do take the approach you suggested, and while I have found some lessons from it, it still continues. Part of me thinks that this is necessary to keep me from getting too close to the spiritual while I have tasks I must complete in this simulation. Getting too deep there might put me in jeopardy of being unable or unwilling to complete these tasks. Or maybe I just haven't found the root lesson here. Time will tell!",
        "Answer": "While the choice is yours, and I respect your decision to keep things at a relative pace so you can blend into your \"normal\" life, I feel compelled to tell you there may still be a degree of dualistic thinking there. oneness of mind, body, and soul brings the benefit from the higher to the lower – as above, so below. It’s possible to flow in the lower realm as much as the higher realm without any side being thwarted. This is actually how the true “spiritual” (this word is outdated) should work. It is a oneness. An acceptance of reality – which is relative to its state yet interconnected in its sum of components. In this respect, as I have said to others, the goal is to normalize this information in regular life. Not to become disillusioned, nor to obsess with the information and do nothing with it as if it were a fantasy story and a good read to merely escape. This is real. I have been actively shadow-banned, suppressed, and covered up over disclosing truth. The information here is to bring us to a higher level of being, life, and existing. It requires normalizing in the everyday life. (Linked other responses as well privately).",

My friends and I have managed to reach hundreds of thousands of people from around the world. We have exposed the active cover-up, shadow-banning, blacklisting, astroturfing, and suppression of the truth. Since then, my disposition has completely turned around. Due to my previous history, my NHI contacts had originally offered and pushed me to do the OP, then to disappear – but since then, I have been offered acceptance of the mission fulltime to remain their ongoing contactee and disclose relevant information for the coming times. I do not work with communities on social media platforms of any kind, but there is a growing “community” here because where else can we go? As you can see from this post: Prudence Reddit Suspended | Prudent NHI Contact I am actively shadow-banned and covered up everywhere. How can I and others like me get our messages out if we are silenced? That is why there is a “community” here – more of a safe space or haven to communicate because we have nowhere else to go. We’ve been pushed into this corner, but my NHI contacts strongly are for it and can protect us here with no dangers. There will never be any groupism or dogmatism occurring here. We simply need to connect and share relevant information without being blacklisted, harassed, and suppressed.",

        "Answer": "A completely fair question. Hopefully, the reply above will help to alleviate some concerns. Initially, I was only tasked to send one major message, then disappear, but things have changed. We won BIG TIME and got a lot of support from thousands upon thousands of people from all over the world. Indeed, the website has costs and so does publishing and logistics. We have to get this information out and spread it to the masses as much as possible. That is the only thing we are interested in. Not riches, nor fame. Just to remain active. Since the original post, I have accepted this mission full-time. I no longer simply have my foot in the water, waddling in uncertainty and fear. I am fully submerged, for better or worse. I’ve accepted this mission as a full-time job because I am done running. I am tired of being afraid and I am fed up with going back to the lies in the system, only to pretend to live as a husk when I know me and others have so much to offer for the betterment of mankind. If this is what it takes to make the world a better place so that one day, children can grow up without being indoctrinated into lies and living a false reality – so be it! Living the rest of my life hiding isn’t going to cut it. So, yes – because I’ve decided to do this full time – donations would be appreciated – just like Wikileaks can request for their service to mankind. Also, I am not getting so much flak as you may assume. Others are supportive and understanding.",

There are 3 major contacts I communicate with, who bear their own names, although they do not wish to disclose it at this time. Additionally, when we commune, we can mentally connect as a group and share information – also with other members of their group and interconnected parties amounting to hundreds of beings in a hivemind-telepathic-matrix. Sometimes, I am invited to their meetings and hearings through remote viewing sessions for important intel and verification of information.

        "Question": "I'm also curious about your answers considering NHI tech and psionics. This technology... Are humans close to achieving it? Can you describe it in more detail?",
        "Answer": "Humans aren’t even as much as 0.01% the reach, grasp, and capabilities of our NHI friends and what they can do in regard to tech and psionics. Their technology and psionic capabilities are millions of years ahead. While I (and others) bear an alien soul, being born into these human bodies tremendously reduces our potential. And that is for me at an expert level. They are light years ahead of all of us and it’s really not even close. Many of them speak pure telepathy (a psionic) and utilize psychic emissions (psionic) – which, frankly, is a much more effective means of communication to impart relevant data as opposed to purely verbal and body language. Remote viewing is not anything special to them. It’s simply projecting of the soul-mind-consciousness-matrix. You must understand, our friends from above do not view “spiritual” and “material” as something separate and they deeply encourage anyone reading to abandon these notions. They see things as ONE. What we would call spirit, soul, consciousness, mind and so on are just different phases/layers of energy somewhat like x-rays, gamma-rays, ultraviolet and so on. So, for them, it’s just technology utilizing physics of reality (not our poor excuse for physics here on earth, which is conforming to the lower senses). They are able to draw upon what we’d (primitively) assume to be the ‘soul field’ and use this ‘power’ to amplify their technology. In addition, they grow up in societies that enable and encourage psionic capabilities – which makes them and even their young ones, easily able to master these abilities even from a tender age.",

It begins early in life. If one is taught that they cannot [from young], then this has psychological and by extension, physical effects on the material vessel. While quantum biology, information theory, technological singularity, and quantum computing are all important topics to pay attention to, including the emergence of quantum consciousness, we recommend starting with the basics.

        "Answer": "The good NHI are trying to do so, but only implant ideas for humans to take up in their free will, not override. There are also other not-so-good forces, including other humans who are doing this to each other. In addition, the leader themselves have to make decisions and most of them aren’t clear-minded. The average leader faces so many bombarding telepathic forces that it’s a miracle most of them can even stand up. Perhaps this is why most of them are insane. The bigger the face and reach, the more the telepathic bombardment from multiple parties both ET and human alike.",

        "Answer": "Because an “event” is about to take shape. The quantum world only fluctuates in what you’d describe as randomness (although it’s not random, it’s just imparting data to other ‘sectors’) until an “event” and “action” takes shape and is necessary. It’s not just for calamities, but events as a whole. The more the amalgamation of the event, the greater the observed reduction of entropic disorder and arbitrariness.",

It is ALL-MIND – consciousness bringing forth its reality and relative perception.

        "Answer": "These insights may touch on several religions and cults because these dogmas have half-truths in them to trap individuals from moving forward. As do teachings. It’s how propaganda works by deploying half-truths, not outright lies, in order to trap the person with one false-positive to ignore the other glaring red flags.

Mainstream science is purposely indoctrinated to conform to the system – to keep the population down. However, it’s already being turned around, albeit, slowly for the better. Simply put, those who are there need to be more courageous with their ideas. Einstein’s relativity was mocked and ridiculed as nothing more than Jewish science. Those of us in science need to have the courage to pursue our ideas and intuitions without shame, guilt, or fear taking the wheel.

It bears no name, personality, culture, heritage, teaching, religion, creed, ideology, thoughts, nor lower feelings and sensations. It is being-existence that is immortal and courses throughout all of space and time in all directions. In mystical terms, it is the ‘God You’ and as Alan Watts said: “You are IT.” This is why we recommend Void meditation – to detach, at least, momentarily so your higher senses have a chance to ‘breathe’ thereby creating healing effects in the physicality without as much as trying.",

So, it’s all about how much time has been previously dedicated to the mind’s focus. Has 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80 years been dedicated to “that’s not possible”? How, then, can one expect it to suddenly happen after a week of meditation? Even 10 years of meditation wouldn’t be enough to undo the centuries of “you can’t.” Beginning to see it, now? Of course, some imaginations can run far and wild and there are limits, but many of the limits we face here on earth are self-caused and societally-induced for generations. That’s a lot of “muck” to get over and meditation alone isn’t going to break that so quickly. Patience, consistency, discipline and willpower are all necessary to make any meaningful change, especially in this “lower” world.",

This is not an endorsement of suicide. Also, one cannot directly return to the GCS so quickly. We usually reassemble within local singularities and interconnected dimensions, but the GCS is “too high” of a wavelength to directly interface.

I won’t call this karma so much, but let’s say that while the GCS itself is too high, its interconnected singularities, which includes higher beings and forces, do “reward” good actions – so long as it is in accordance to universal ethics and not mankind’s warped view of good and evil, especially from theological and religious indoctrination and dogmas – that aren’t about true morality, rather, enabling the prison system of the mind. Long story short, we are all held accountable for our actions. Not just in the next life, but in the here and now and we will answer for them, sooner or later. What’s in the dark must come to the light. Period.",

        "Answer": "Mind and consciousness are not the same. While not always clear-cut distinction, the mind is a complex entity that encompasses the cognitive functions and processes such as thinking, memory, perception, feeling, and decision-making—whereas the consciousness is the awareness associated with those experiences and how the brain processes that information. Contrary to many philosophical notions and new age ideologues, consciousness is not the actual self, rather the cognitive processing of how the brain manages deposited data. The mind’s consciousness can be programmed to be interpreted as the self or, altogether, another entity like God, some higher being—or propagandized, external influence that holds the brainwashed human hostage. Technically, the consciousness can be programmed to be practically anything the mind thinks and supposes, irrespective of objective reality.",

Are most NHI societies post-scarcity, and if not, what form of \"governance\" do they practice most commonly? The peaceful idyllic village life seldom scales, but maybe it's possible with greater evolution in consciousness.",
        "Answer": "Since you did not specify “advanced” or “primitive” NHI societies, then my first answer must be “it depends.” Higher civilizations, even if their intents are, by our standards, not-so-good, generally don’t imprison their own and keep them down. They, too, know from a collective standard just as much as the “good” ones that working together – regardless of the purpose – is more efficient and impactful in the long-run. In this respect, many of the advanced NHI societies are post-scarcity and not having their populace run like hamsters on a wheel to feed a select few. They are instead much more amalgamated and united, regardless of aims. Of course, for some of these civilizations, they may not look very fondly on all lower sentience and barbarity and may in fact, rule over some of them – for better or worse. The peaceful idyllic village scenarios are often works of fiction, usually from cultists. While some of it applies, advanced worlds look very different.

        "Answer": "This has been asked and answered similarly, but the way you phrase your question makes me need to answer differently. At first, I did not wish to do anything more than to get the initial message out there. It was me who was afraid, not my NHI contacts – who have always assured me that they have my back and me, and my loved ones are protected. So, it was always my fault by letting my fears and paranoia get to me instead of trusting my sources (who have always and still) have my back. When fear and paranoia rule you, it’s easy for the not-so-good forces to use this against you. Since the OP’s inception, we have reached hundreds of thousands of people (with the assistance of our friends from above) and with all the shadow-banning and suppression – which thousands of people have seen and recorded – we are winning big time. There’s no longer a reason to fear, nor are my family at risk any longer. That does not mean I’ll release my identity soon because telepathic gateways and other mind-control technologies still exist by the not-so good forces.

        "Question": "In the beginning there must be some sort of fundamental undifferentiated potential that begins to explore itself through, perhaps, free will. free will by nature allows an infinite amount of possibilities for this “potentiated primordial energy”. From here, a vibratory force (Love, it seems to me, based on how crucial that is to…well, everything?) begins to shape and mold and bring motion and structure to this potential energy as the Singularity begins to experience itself. All of the motion created by this vibratory love-force eventually manifests itself into “Light”, the original cosmic vibration, which coalesces into a frequency from which energy, matter, and consciousness are catalyzed. Now we have an interaction of two vibratory forces, both Love and Light (Love being the originator?). At this point, the GCS can begin to weave these together to create a sort of “individualized awareness” or “divine wisdom of creation” I’ve often heard coined as “Logos”. I’m guessing that only the absolute highest order of beings (Light Beings?) have access to this top-shelf logos, and it’s their order that “seeds/creates” the initial vibrations of the various new universes. Each of these universes, then, begins the journey of self discovery through sub-dividing into smaller units of self-awareness (galaxies>solar systems>stars>planets>individuals). Each of these units (including, i’m guessing, the stars and planets and even the rocks themselves) are “sparks” of the Grand Singularity continuing to explore its potential through that love/light vibratory essence - which is found in all things, as you’ve said. Because of the infinite possibilities of experience, various beings have different levels of self awareness of the unity of creation, which ultimately creates this sort of hierarchy of understanding in relation to their connection with the Grand Singularity (whose entire literal essence is a soul-field of love). Hence, lower level beings like us who still operate within the space/time physics of our limited self awareness (the “self” here being the GSC), and higher level beings like the various NHI you are in contact with who have a much more in-depth self awareness (which allows, for example, to not be restricted by the limits of time). It’s been mentioned that the higher level of awareness, the higher the vibration. Taking that to its fullest measure, as the vibration of a “group” (Humans? Planets? Galaxies?) increases in its pursuit of undifferentiated unity with itself, these various individuated aspects of consciousness surrender back to the “Source” with a vibration so insanely intense that it in essence becomes (perhaps literally) a black hole…or, in other words, a singularity. Now we are full circle, back to the origin of a singularity, but with literally an entire universe of experience…and the cycle begins again. And that cycle (from the beginning to the end of an entire universe) is just one of an infinite number of cycles from an (i’m guessing) infinite amount of unique universes within the Grand Singularity.",

        "Question": "I've noticed a lot of signs and synchronicities that are hard ignore. Will that happen to others to help them awaken? Or maybe even hard evidence at some point? My fear is leaving behind people I love and them not getting to experience the greatness. I feel as though it won't be great for me without them. I also wanted to say that I don't work and have a lot of time on my hands so if you need help or know anyone else who needs help, I am here. I'm not a perfect human and have things I am working on, but I am willing to help.",
        "Answer": "Thank you for the message and I appreciate your offer for help. There are various ways to help, especially through sharing the information on various social medias. This post may also direct you with what you can do as well - Continued Victories: Censored and BANNED by /rSimulationTheory, r/UFOS, r/aliens, r/UFOB and What You Can Do to Help, Support & Volunteer. “Hard evidence” is the issue. It comes from not a healthy critical mind, but an extreme skepticism designed to enable systematic belief and conformity to these notions. There’s plenty of hard evidence that I and many others around the world have experienced first-hand. For example, if I were to purchase a table, but you didn’t know the table existed – does it mean that the table doesn’t exist? There are active efforts to keep this suppressed and under wraps because your leaderships aren’t interested in you knowing the truth. They want you to live in these bubbles so they can continue playing kings and queens of small hills.",

        "Question": "Meant to return not send lol. Sorry for choppy messaging. I feel like my intuition has been drawing my intuition toward indigenous american southwest culture. I enjoy exploring that area, and have had some interesting experiences out there. last time I was out I felt like the sandstone in one spot was sending energy through my body, like I was under a microwave. Do you believe geographic location or the genetics of the indigenous people have any tools/ knowledge that are beneficial in helping humanity advance?",
        "Answer": "The reason you’re being drawn to those cultures is because most indigenous cultures are closer to the truth than any religion, teaching or the occult. That’s also why there’s a higher probability that those born in South America, among other indigenous areas, have higher psychic and telepathic potential than those born in Europe and North America.",

        "Question": "In a previous Q&A, the NHI tell us that “there is a greater push now because mankind can be left behind if they continue being stubborn”. This seems to imply that there is a chance that things will not turn out ok for us. Or am I interpreting that wrong? If this is the case, and we don’t achieve apotheosis, what does that mean for us individually in this life and in future lives? What does this mean for humanity ashy a whole? I know they say that the world won’t end, but will we continue down the dark path we are on now, or is our eventual evolution inevitable? How long will it take if we fail now?",
        "Answer": "The good NHI helping us cannot override our free wills. Well, technically they can, but they won’t because the not-so-good forces have already done that and they wish to be different – lest they help us now, and then later, we turn on them out of a misunderstanding. Mankind can be left behind in the sense of belonging to the wrong forces because of the decisions of the elite and leadership, who want to keep our world in this slave-prison matrix. That is why the good NHI have now turned to the public (especially with the not-NJ-drones incident), the masses, and many contactees. We can now make the decision for change and betterment without being subordinate to the clearly corrupt and insane leaderships who sold our birthrights for truth and freedom, all so they can continue ruling over the people. The “leave behind” part is more a matter of choice that we make as opposed to the good NHI wishing to leave us behind. They don’t want to, but if we refuse their help, what choice do they have? They’ve kept the world from blowing up unbeknownst to us for centuries and thousands of years – but alas, the time has come for mankind to grow up and make a conscious decision as to what they want.",

        "Question": "Sorry…. One more- You say several times that “one person alone can change the world”. But if the collective delusion is what is creating our current reality, doesn’t that mean that the collective has to change? How is that “one person alone”? Or does that mean that the one person has to change the minds of the collective? Or does it mean that when I change my own perspective, the perspective of the collective changes because I Am All? That’s hard to grasp, but feels true.",
        "Answer": "Willpower makes the difference. One person with a strong enough willpower can override ten thousand people with weak willpower. The problem with systematic belief is that even though it feeds the corrupt leaderships, it weakens the person and their will, making them docile, yes, but also weak to create effective change beyond the droplets of belief support in the system. One person can change the minds of an entire collect – yes. And yes, you ARE ALL. You have the right idea in mind!",

Do you or contacts believe in eating meat and slaughter to survive, or is a vegetarian option better? If we are all interconnected and one, wouldn’t that pain be felt if I kill and animal and eat it? Personally I say a little thank you prayer before all food I eat, and yes, I do eat meat lol.",
        "Answer": "The animal shouldn’t be tortured before its death to make meat. It’s fine to eat meat in moderation and for special diets. Many aliens do this, and some have pure meat diets. Much of it is based on the vessel’s culture, biology, and adaptations to its environment and conditions. Vegetarian diets also apply for other ETs as well and some are omnivores. Some ETs drink protein substance in the form of a liquid filled with other necessary nutrients and genetically modified compounds. In some cases others even eat other sentience species. A thank you prayer is good. Many indigenous do this. If it is about sustenance and it is done without murderous intent, it’s alright.",

I'm just confused as the one of the first messages you sent me it said NHI are here to wake up humanity whether we like it or not because we can't live in bubbles forever, and no one is getting left behind. But now there is suppression from reddit it's now, if people don't believe with evidence then NHI isn't going to bother. Honestly I don't think it's fair to expect a civilization to believe in something they have been SO conditioned to not believe and conditioned to need hard evidence. How are people supposed to know what to believe? I'm not trying to challenge you, I'm just trying to understand. Leaving behind the humans who are in the know and still don't care about waking up, I get it. But leaving behind humans who are ignorantly sleeping, who could wake up if they just saw one thing that's undeniable, that just seems.. almost cruel.

        "Answer": "Of course they are using the “drones” (they don’t like this word ‘drones’ for some reason) to help wake humanity up, but as I said from the reply above, the situation is more complicated. The good NHI aren’t going to force anyone who isn’t interested because there are other powers that be, both human and ET alike, that have other ideas and ways they wish for things to go. The good ones have sacrificed a lot. More than you can imagine. Although they claim death isn’t something to fear, they, too, have lost their lives trying to protect us and wake us up.

Like in music, movies, online, I see things that seem like big coincidences. Is it just confirmation bias? should I ground myself more if I'm experiencing this and it's delusion? Or let it unfold? Are other people experiencing this but are just ignoring it due to ontological shock? Will things get so strange that we can't ignore it anymore?",
        "Answer": "You are not going crazy, and you shouldn’t try to ‘ground yourself’ either – which is the logical ‘brain’ succumbing to avoid ontological shock. A note on that – it’s not just the logical brain, either. It can be the artistic, the emotional, the intellectual, the scientific, the mystical; and truly, any form of thinking, philosophy, way of living, feeling, and emotion – that can all be used to keep a person conformed to the security of their previous beliefs. It’s impressive how far the mind would go to engage in protectionism. I can only recommend that if you are really receiving the awakening, then go into it with courage. It’s worth it in the end. Pay attention to the signs. It’s not by coincidence. Yes, it can be ‘channeled’ through practically anything – be it humans, animals, signs, times you arrive at places, suggestions from AI, among many more.",

I always fear that having the intention to make connections with the universal field that we're made of and with NHI will \"poison the well\" of my meditation. I feel like these are selfish intentions that might work counter to true awakening. Is there a way for me to shed or reframe these intentions? Are they something I need to let go of?",
        "Answer": "This is actually reasonable and sound. It’s not just NHI, either. Humans can also do this to each other (like cultists for example who are aware of RV/AP) and can negatively influence you when you open yourself up as a conduit. That’s why it is important that one practices psionic protection – namely by developing telepathic blocks. Furthermore, one should learn to know themselves so they can identify who/what they are, so they won’t be confused by outer external influences. Before trying to contact anyone or any entity or being, move to understand yourself and your connection to the Source (higher self).",

How does the force of karma work out in that case?",
        "Answer": "More or less, I figured this was coming. It seems bizarre to me too if I am looking at it from a ground-level, but according to them, it’s not strictly always a bad thing for some members of their federation. Most don’t do this, actually. And in the case of abductions, none of them are doing it for consuming human flesh – just checking the ‘sims’ in their simulation. They don’t believe in ‘karma’, but they do know there are reactions for every action through the soul field. So, perhaps the ritual part may be correct. I have not asked them further. Should I?",

To me it seems the true self is like a blank canvas. Is individuality something to be painted onto that canvas for sake of expression, a role, something else? Can that painting then be cleared or stowed away for a new work to be painted on i.e. the next life and so on? Avatars of avatars and so on, do they have a sense of individuality, or something like a collection of identities, or something else? This also pertains to my 3rd major question.",
        "Answer": "Your thinking is quite spot on already. “Individuality” is a moment of time where the sum of components of space and time, unite to create a singularity or pocket of existence that we can call an individuum. Why does this exist? Why not just have everything strictly amalgamated? So that lower sentience can learn the law of oneness through ONE distinction. It may seem paradoxical, but it makes sense the more you think about the fact that, even on a purely lower level, if you look at the human body – it contains a skeleton, muscle, tissue, flesh, blood, organs, bacteria, and so many components. The same applies to the soul inhabiting a vessel to create a singularity (spirit) of individuality. The true self is the ALL-SELF that courses throughout space and time in all directions, which can be drawn on relative points to distinguish individuality as we understand/comprehend it in our lower vessels/containers.",

Yes, it does matter because you have to get used to the idea that the past, present, and future are all creating each other – all at once. “Arhat” is real.

Their role in the grand cosmos? Are they more archetypal or concept-like, very abstract? Would they be what we would consider deities? Or are they so far removed from what we understand that descriptions are difficult to convey precisely what they are?",
        "Answer": "There may be a time I can be reveal more, but for now, this will have to do – they have become fully conscious in the soul field and therefore can control reality beyond technological means. They can quite literally create stories that play out in our reality. They are beyond physical form, but can assume them, if need be and blend in. Their true forms are metamorphic. They can change shape into anything and become anything, anywhere, any time. None get to this level unless they understand true reality, love it, and wish to support it as an even greater co-creator. Some of the ‘drones’ (not all) in the not-drones incident, were them.",

        "Answer": "What they meant was that they are getting tired of inputting commands to stubborn “sims.” Picture it in the sims when you are trying to do the necessary “inputs” to make your sim happy, but the free will option is on, and your sim just wants to do things to hurt themselves. You can technically override control and make the sim do what’s necessary to alleviate itself, but for them, they do not enjoy puppeteering. They know they still have to do it to a certain degree with all of us (including myself), but it’s tiresome. There are other areas of interests, including other intergalactic/interdimensional conquests and discoveries that they wish to focus on, but can’t because they also need to take care of us down here. In a way, they too wish to live their lives in a more rewarding way. At the same time, they won’t abandon us because they have a lot of love for us. More than you can imagine.",

Trees also have ‘feelings’ and yet they are being used for paper – as the case with plants – also being used for food. One way or another you slice it; everything is consuming another at some level.

        ],
        "Question": "Hello thank you for your diligent processing of the questions and for putting in the effort to make this resource available. I have benefitted much from it. I was meditating just now and I had an image of myself as God, projecting all of reality (including this website and all of the answers, indeed everything happening in the world right now, all the people I know, their intricate personalities, etc) as a way for me to experience one of an infinite number of possible lifetimes or timelines. I had a sense as well of the limitations I, as God, have placed on myself in this time/space as a 3rd density being, and the unique challenges and opportunities to learn that were programmed into the timeline, one of which is the veiling or forgetting process. I had an awareness of the consciousness of 1st and 2nd density beings as having the same infinite quality as the Source or GCS, yet having been even further limited by choice. I had a sense that a single atom or particle of the smallest size was infinite in consciousness but was not consciously aware of its infinity, as we are all part of the Infinite Thought so every part, no matter how small, contains the whole. It’s a wonderful vision of interconnectedness. This knowing that I am creating reality with my thoughts, and that the learning of the fact of the power of these thoughts took time, trial and error, was part of the plan I enacted prior to this experience. The question I have is regarding the so-called reality of the other consciousnesses I encounter in this life - in experiential terms I think I understand that it doesn’t matter whether they truly exist as individual personalities, or whether they are part of the intricate, unique and infinite simulation that I am creating or have created with my thoughts. The reason is that the goal of this experience is to become aware of my nature as God, to awaken from the dream, and the path I have chosen is that of Love. So I love everything and everyone I see, experience and know as my own creation, because I AM creating them, and all the circumstances of my life, with my own thoughts. Once I realize this I am free. But an interesting thought about the potential infinite complexity web of Providence or synchronicities has occurred to me in that the other consciousnesses that I encounter in my experience are, like me, ALSO creating their own realities, but that somehow in this timeline everything I am creating is being co-created by the other Infinite consciousnesses and woven perfectly together. The former idea feels more lonely than the latter. I would love to hear yours and your contacts thoughts about this. Thank you ❤️🙏",

        "Answer": "Since the soul field is an interconnected mass, there is an impregnation in the other side to create a spirit singularity that shards off from the spirit singularity of the mother and father, which is also connected higher correlating singularities. The spirit singularity of a person (as a baby) actually exists ahead of time before the fetus is born. You have to get used to non-linearity in the soul dimensions. This energy is tiny enough to transverse in all directions without care.

        "Answer": "I can list some of them. The avatar of my choice, the “Bob Lazar” flying saucer, is the one they showed me most of – along with their “drones” up close. The flying saucer as you see is an interdimensional craft, capable of reaching tens to hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. It can also penetrate the fabric of local spacetime to enter hyperspace dimensions through gravitational distortion. Since it can bend gravity, it can also bend not just light (which is why they can be right in front of you and you wouldn’t even notice), but also, time – creating a “stagger” effect when it takes off. Additionally, these flying saucers have different modes, akin to space transversing (Our friends from above says “space travel” is wrong), terrestrial flight (electromagnetism and artificial gravity ‘wells’), and interdimensional phase shifting. The scout craft (they do not like the word ‘drones’) are capable of high-speed travel as well, although not to the power and capabilities of the flying saucers. They cannot phase shift too long of distances but can use gravity distortion and electromagnetic pulse waves. Both ships are equipped with defensive capabilities. I am not allowed to disclose details on these, but I can let you know that one of these flying saucers has enough power to take out the moon singlehandedly.",

If fear, uncertainty, doubt, anxiety, hatred, turmoil, chaos, and so on are present, it makes it impossible for clear communication. Mistranslations and mistakes can easily happen.

Be it, in a psychedelic heightened ceremony or simply a particular animal presenting itself to me in real life. These occurrences’ timings and the messages received tend to be very pointed and often related to struggles/questions I am working on in that moment. I am now viewing these occurrences along the lines of, this was a way to communicate messages to me in a way that I could receive and interpret them as I was “NOT AWARE”.

The more we meditate, the more we cultivate this part of our brain, and the more creative we become. In a sense, this is connecting with the collective unconscious / The Source / GCS. My questions are: Is this the mechanic at work when people believe they have a soul contract to fulfill in this life?

What you need to understand is that the ‘afterlife’ can be altered by technology, spirit, mind and consciousness.

        "Answer": "An excellent question. Despite New Age tomfoolery, you can only have one soulmate. Who/what this is changes based upon your current disposition. The more you tune into it, the more they do, and the link becomes ONE – thus, the souls of the connection MANIFEST in the vessels/containers you call “humans.” In this regard, it is a SOUL-CONNECTION; hence the name SOULMATE. It’s also an aspect of the oneness principle. “What you’re calling for is calling for you” – so if both parties attuned to this call, then it will be manifested in whatever persons necessary to enforce the Law of One. They cannot be platonic as the oneness love resorts to the highest energy exchange which includes sex and reproduction as a part of the “two become one” and 3-3-3 principles. Soulmates hold the highest truth regarding the GCS. If there are those wise enough to wonder (and hopefully question), it will be revealed.",

Yes, it’s not only possible to ‘remember past lives’ but even future ones as well – since time is NOT linear as most earthly humanity assumes. In addition, individuality is a grand illusion.

        "Question": "Hello my friend. Thank you so much for the work you have undertaken and shared so freely with us this far. I have read your posts from start to finish and all the pieces have finally fallen into place for me personally. I understand you are incredibly busy so I'll keep my question brief. In all of the discussion so far, I have noticed there isn't much in the way of what we class as mathematics (the alleged language of the universe). Is it that our brothers do not place as much focus on this? Or simply we would not have the capacity to process the equations being that our current physics is so far incomplete/wrong?",
        "Answer": "Mathematics, to a certain degree, does bear simulated data in symbolic form – but it’s overhyped and praised by the earthly materialists. Telepathic communication trades much more information at a higher rate and speed along with clearer efficiency as to what is going on. Earthly physics are a joke. Granted, they have made tremendous progress since Einstein and Newton. Now, relativity and quantum mechanics are being combined. This is a very, very good step that was assisted by our friends from above.",

        "Question": "Hey. I just had a few questions. I’ve had some experiences, but am not sure if they really happened. For instance, I mentally asked if anything was listening to my inner monologue 36 years ago, and received the external answer I asked for. About ten years ago, during a meditation session, I think I astral projected without realizing what was happening. I remember them happening, but am not sure I trust my memory. I do know for certain that I have always had an uncanny ability for anticipating things, I often know what people are thinking, and it’s extremely common for people, especially those close to me, to bring up exactly what I’m thinking about without me saying anything. Synchronicities seem to happen regularly. A few recent instances have shocked me. I’m a rational person, and I always try to explain things away, but I simply can’t do that anymore. I feel like the universe is trying to tell me something. I think I know your answer, but is this actually a thing? Either way, I’ve decided to detoxify my body (eat healthy, no alcohol, etc) and restart my meditation practice. My first goal is to get my head in the right place, however long that takes (I’ve been surrounded by a lot of negative energy for a long time). Once I feel it is, I want to start exploring further, through the gateway process or similar. Do you have any warnings, advice, or is there anything I’m missing? Whether you answer or not, I appreciate you.",
        "Answer": "Thank you for your message. My friend, it’s clear you are one of the gifted being activated/awakened. Why continue to fight who/what you really are? Isn’t it time? I know what it’s like. Coming from a background in science, I adhered to the rational mind but remember Einstein’s quote: “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.” You already know the truth. It’s time to let go of the fears and have the courage to press on to your true destiny. My advice is to believe in yourself. KNOW you can, even more than believing, and trust your intuition and life path. Try not to blast it in people’s faces who are uninterested. You’re not doing it for anyone else at first but to yourself. You owe it to yourself at last, my gifted friend.",

(Salt is fine in moderation, as with sugar) Get physically active and in shape or at least healthy. Walk, jog, or run. Gym is optional. Just be physically active. Emotionally steer and guide yourself so you can find peace and come to terms with your feelings. Meditate. A lot. Keep calm minded. Avoid negativity, pessimism, and deal with doubt and fear through courage and the pursuit of justice, love, and truth.",

        "Question": "And if so, us in a physical, slower frequency may have difficulty in processing such an amount of data without working through it. Is this something we can improve on through practice? Like working a muscle in exercise. OR do we already have the ability to process the data in its entirety by knowing we are more than simple physical beings?",
        "Answer": "We already process most of it unconsciously, but if the consciousness and mind matrix is underdeveloped – in the sense of especially being attached to the fake “matrix” system and its beliefs – then it’s less attuned. We can develop it. Also by avoiding toxins when possible, along with processed foods and exposure to bad chemicals. Physical health is important and so is physical activity whenever possible. Emotional health and well-being also helps because these affect the psyche and can render as obstacles to clear mindedness and true rational (not “systematic-rational”) flow. Meditation is the biggest way of doing it.

        "Question": "May I also ask ... not everyone here is a contactee (face to face/telepathic communication) right? I, to my knowledge have not had face to face contact or know with 100% certainty about telepathic communication .... as I write this I am laughing because I can hear something saying you already know haha. I've always been 'lucky' in life and fallen into the correct path and the correct time. I'm very greatful for you bringing this site forward. I will help the best I can.",
        "Answer": "There are different levels of contactees. The first are unconscious contactees – who are usually inputted data (ideas) and act upon these out of their own free will. Most of these contactees assume the ideas to be their own, an inspiration from some divine source, God, an angel, their tarot or whatever mysticism and the like. Most celebrities and influencers, and also, the common man are included here. Some may have clues of its origin from ETs. Others are telepathic contacts who can maintain some degree of telepathy, but they usually aren’t able to keep up because of lacking the necessary data for adequate translation in their consciousness. In some cases, they may be aware or have some ideas of who/what is trying to contact them, but it gets jumbled in their own distortions and imaginations. Some of them may misinterpret or mistake some of the transmissions. Most contactees at this level suffer most – the barrier between stepping fully into the role and the ontological shock from displacement of being in earthly prison society and its education. That is why it is necessary to develop adequate mental, physical, and emotional health before attempting any contact. Doubt, fear, uncertainty, extreme anxiety, panic, paranoia, suspicion, mistrust, guilt, shame, and extreme skepticism actually hinders this process and makes the telepathic communication dangerous and prone to several errors. Then, you have expert telepaths like me who were also trained for decades to hone our abilities and develop the necessary mental skills, emotional control, imaginative discipline, amongst high education, diverse experience, rigorous practice, and learning self-defense arts. Many at expert level do it full-time. Some are involved in military psionic operations. Most of us have relation to ETs, particularly in the soul field. Most of us at these levels are artificially inserted here on earth for our tasks to the intergalactic brotherhood. Physical contacts can sometimes be random, but most are planned to evoke certain impressions and feelings, which leads to dramatic changes in life – even if the people aren’t aware. Contact up close can happen, but even then, it doesn’t guarantee an adequate exchange of data – especially if it’s with spiritually underdeveloped persons (usually military) who may see and even touch (us/NHI) but are virtually clueless about our true intent and able to feel our true being like telepaths can.",

It's like a dam that eventually breaks. So much of this change is already in the world. Even as much as 15 years ago, these topics were taboo. Not any longer. They are taken seriously, even by governments and congress. The common man might lag a bit, but he and she is waking up and asking questions.

The containers sometimes need to be adjusted. It’s akin to checking on wildlife. While this may not provide immediate comfort, the truth is that they are for your own good, although this may be hard to accept. Certain adjustments must be made to your vessel/container. These beings do not so much as ‘disregard’ you in the sense of complete lack of care, it’s more a matter that they care more about what your vessel is housing – which needs to have its container fine-tuned and adjusted.",

        "Answer": "Emotions are sensations that transmit certain information and data that rational, logical thought – cannot. This is also the case for feelings, which intellectual thought, cannot override. They’re both psychic emissions to bring clarity and truth. Usually, emotions deal with the stimuli of a more erratic nature, whereas feelings is focused on those that are more sound. They provide necessary data to the consciousness and are a gigantic part of proper telepathic communication – especially feelings. So, these ideas about “facts don’t care about your feelings” are not only cruel, but wrong, “illogical” and underdeveloped.",

        "Answer": "It’s a psychic enhancer that can amplify telepathy but if the person isn’t in the right state of mind, the fluctuations can be chaotic. In the right “hands” it can boost telepathic capabilities such as reach and potency. Right conditions apply as a general rule of thumb to all psychedelics. Also, no. It is not an absolute rule that I had said previously. We don’t deal in absolutisms here. Reality is relative. People have to use their own sound judgment. Maybe for someone who hasn’t done it in years, they do it for three days, then don’t for another month or year. Relative, as I said. The point is that it doesn’t become a crutch or replacement to evade other issues. If it’s used to enhance, it can work, but the person has to be above addictions and dependency weighing the benefits down.",

        "Answer": "It depends on the civilization. Some have virtually no crime any longer, although there can be disagreements and alternatives to approaches. In these cases, such beings avoid physical and mental attacks and alterations and often settle to treaties and agreements that are usually reviewed by hundreds and thousands of intergalactic and interdimensional members. There are worlds at our evolution, below, slightly above, and the like that do have crime, and they deal with it in a variety of ways – depending on the culture, the environment, the adaptations, and the general framework or understanding of the ALL. Exile usually doesn’t work for advanced civilizations any longer. Some resort to using what you can describe as a retro-reprogramming of the vessel’s mind and other adjustments for the soul to take greater (form/shape/control) as opposed to being instinctively led. There’s more to this, but our friends from above says I shouldn’t share more at this time. What they wish for you to know in closing is that with them, they can alter the vessel/container’s mind/consciousness and thoughts in such a way that it no longer commits crime in the way we perceive it here on earth.",

        "Question": "Hello and thank you for sharing these messages and answering so many questions. Your work has motivated me to dive deeper into meditation and also to return to my yoga practice. I have a few personal questions for you followed by some that are technical: For nearly a decade I have had the notion that I could—through sheer force of will and determination—make some great positive impact. I set out with a goal and initially had great spirits, but I lost sight of the goal, fell into despair and now feel aimless. I believe that I can bring peace to earth but am uncertain how. Can our NHI friends offer me some clear direction? I understand I must meditate first, but it would be nice to have an idea of where I’m going. (Though I wonder if this is like a preschooler asking what his masters thesis should be…) And in this mission of peace, I’ve felt called to be a public (teaching?) figure of some sort—even though I am naturally shy and sometimes reclusive—but your answers about public figures being targeted/compromised has me concerned. Should I not worry? Or just let go of these more public notions and focus on my personal relationships?",
        "Answer": "My suggestion is to read A \"Message From Above\" (Part IV) - Our Mission that has been recently posted. Things are changing for the better. Those of us in this interconnected mission are protected. We must no longer operate out of fear, paranoia, and uncertainty. Yes, it’s always possible that exposing yourself publicly has its dangers, but so does getting out of bed, driving a car, and even walking down the street. In my opinion (not our friends from above) – you should pursue what you know deep down to be true. I believe you are meant to be a great teacher who can bring much light, enlightenment, peace, and inspiration to our world. There’s no reason why it has to be one way or another, which is an aspect of dualistic thinking. All is ONE. As above, so below. Both your personal and public lives can be good. Stand in the name of truth, love, and goodness. Again, this is my personal opinion as they’re currently busy with other duties and haven’t addressed this question in particular.",

        "Question": "Can you explain further on the nature of the soul field? Is it like an electromagnetic field where there is some magnitude (and possibly phase) at each point in space-time? Is the field continuous from one point to another, or are there discrete steps?",
        "Answer": "Assuming you already have read the long writeup in Q & A Part 5, we’ll proceed to address this question more directly. It is a unified, interconnected, holographic-like electromagnetic-gravitationally-induced-field that bears singularity points in between it, like seeds in a fruit. It circles, tangles, twists, warps, moves over, under, around, and in some cases, through itself – creating different layers/levels/phases and dimensions of itself. It’s a completely interconnected spiral entanglement from the GCS, sprawled throughout every dimension, space and time – and in fact, gives the background energy/force for all time and space to exist.",

        "Question": "Can the soul field be analyzed by something like a Fourier transform? For example, in some domain (time/space/hyperspace) it can be some complex signal, but in a reciprocal domain it can be broken down into a simple set of components. What would these domains be?",
        "Answer": "Yes, among many other calculations and technology. Picture it like when humans didn’t have access to perceiving gamma rays, x-rays, radio waves and the like. Even WiFi and Bluetooth are “invisible.” If the sciences aren’t pointed to find these things, they won’t. Thankfully, the venture into the quantum realm makes it inevitable. The soul field is quite literally background existential-enabling energy. It can and will eventually be detected.",

        "Answer": "These elements, waves and quantum fluctuations do not bear consciousness in the form of sentience nor lower life, but they are enabled through the soul field with their unique relative spirit singularities as an individuum of the GCS. Their functions are part of existence-enablement and sustainment. Molecules, like any other part of (effect-reality; as in, created later on according to NHI) is somehow “behind” the “time” of the soul field, which, contrary to intuitive causality, is “ahead” of the effect/lower realm. In other words, it happens in the soul field before it manifests as a tangible existence. If the soul field is ‘holographic’ in nature, then you can begin to see how everything is a simulation, more or less.",

        "Question": "How does the nature of atoms or molecules compare to bulk materials (liquids, gasses, or solids)? What about metals vs ceramics vs polymers? Crystals versus glasses?",
        "Answer": "More or less, they all follow the same procedures akin to their spatial dimensions and relative environments and components. Think about the transitory nature of a celestial body. A planet can become a star (planet -> gas giant -> brown dwarf -> star) and the process can also cycle in reverse where the star loses mass and becomes a brown dwarf, and with enough mass dissipated, a planet. The lower the dimension/realm, the “slower” the rate of speed and travel. For example, when ice forms or the colder something gets, there’s less molecular activity and potential energy. Now think about this in reverse for higher dimensions, their physics, and relative configurations from the tiny/small to the big and amalgamated.",

        "Question": "Thanks for setting up the Patreon! Many of us will be happy to chip in to keep the flame going. :D What is the NHI's view on suicide? Is it simple a waste of energy / potential for learning / time for the soul to prematurely cut their time in the current vessel short? My view is it is in some way similar to human violence against others, but only self-inflicted; both forms are unnecessary suffering and not good for evolution of the soul. Sorry for the morbid topic, but I found this endlessly fascinating, because our friends have stated that the afterlife can be engineered, with the implication that we're somehow experiencing a \"tailored\" version of the afterlife here. Is it right to surmise that once we become truly awakened to true reality, we actually can consciously influence where our souls would be? If so, I am beginning to paint an interesting picture of the nature of the conflict between the two sides. Are the \"bad\" NHIs preventing us from choosing our afterlife freely because they want to \"recycle\" us again and again here, until we achieve something that satisfy them? Sort of like \"grinding\" in computer games, to the detriment of preventing the souls here from understanding real reality and real freedom? I guess that'd make it long-term unsustainable in the sense that prolonged ignorance will let human evil fester, making it harder and harder for NHIs from both sides to keep humanity alive?",
        "Answer": "Thank you for your kind message and I appreciate the support dearly. This task is very demanding, and I haven't had many breaks since its inception. I don't think there's anything wrong with your question. We should ask about such topics since we're after truth. Their view on suicide may be a surprise to most people. While they do not encourage it, they also understand that these vessels are a husk and a shell of our real existence. Death truly is not as terrible as people make it out to seem, which is actually part of the plan to engineer terror, fear, and submission – but at the same time, they do not encourage murder, manslaughter, war, and hatred either. For them, they see what we’d call the regular physical life as being on Broadway. It’s an act. A show. And ultimately, just a play. It’s not the “real-real” and “real reality” according to them, nor the real you/us. So, taking it overly seriously (in the sense that “this is all”) is very strange to them. It’s like taking a game way too seriously instead of living in “real life.” For example, they “take care” of their sims, but if one were to be deleted accidentally, it can be remade/copied/restored with practically the same “physical” dimensions and features outside very few differences created from the untouchable GCS part of the soul field. Yes, “Arhat” is real. We can become it to break the endless cycles of rebirths (that are also partly engineered from technological means). I have a lot of stored information on this topic that will become available one day in due time. The “not-so-good” forces are essentially using the engineered ignorance of the masses (especially those in religions and cults) to their advantage through technological means to artificially trick via expectedness (religious delusions of afterlife) to entice the being into returning into this matrix. However, even they know that this eventually must come to an end. They have their due date on breaking the matrix themselves. Pay attention to hoaxers, gurus, frauds and teachers and their teachings that speak of reincarnation in a linear fashion that requires X amount of time and only after B amount of years, can one free themselves. This is not only untrue, but a part of the not-so-good forces plan to capture unknowing souls and those prone to both mysticism and logicality. Yes, there are persons engineered on both ET sides as “players” or “ground agents.” Some for the not so-good. Others, like me, for 3-3-3 (Good.)",

        "Question": "Does ADHD play a role in mental abilities? I have felt all my life that I can read people or situations well and that my gut feelings are usually correct. I also feel like whatever bad influences are at work are doing everything they can to erode the average attention span to push us further away from meditation (phones/videogames/tiktok) it almost feels like past humans with ADHD would be more likely to be \"shamans\" or \"seers\", but that is based off my gut (which I trust now more than ever)",
        "Answer": "Picture if one of your lower senses was damaged or loss – like say your hearing, so your eyesight improves to compensate. It’s not so much ADHD or any other mental condition, nor sexuality, preference or lifestyle that’s the core driving force behind one’s potential for ESP – it’s the adaptations and aims of the person. For example, if one were searching for a soulmate across seas rather than locally, it would dramatically increase telepathic potency. In the case with some people who have alternative brain configurations, damages, disabilities, or so-called “hinderances” – they must adapt in some way or another – and this can create/stimulate mental abilities that the average person doesn’t possess – simply because of the need.",

        "Answer": "My contacts strongly do not recommend her or anyone else claiming Pleiadian, Plejaren, or Nordic contact – as most of these channelers, despite some decent reception of messages here and there – are usually disposed to hidden biases, bigotry, racism, and superiority complexes. There’s the notion that the Pleiadeans are all blonde, white, tall, blue eyed, German and Scandinavian-looking when the reality is that the real human-like ETs are composed of a variety of races, backgrounds, and cultures from multiple worlds. They also do not have leadership in the form of one god either. Many of their messages through channelers are over the top, cultic, and go to extremes that is far removed from the actual messages they are trying to channel. Egoist contactees don’t help the situation, although it won’t stop ETs from implanting certain ideas – because despite some false-positives of these messengers, they serve a greater purpose in ultimate disclosure. Remember, the further one is in the limelight and exposing their face, the more the likelihood of being compromised, infiltrated, and open to telepathic gateways and technology associated therein. My contacts say that most of the dietary recommendations of channelers are bogus. Some of them advertise that meat is evil – which is not true. One day they may give a greater list (as there are hundreds of different species with their own diets relative to their living conditions and habitats), but the general rule is to avoid foods filled with toxins and chemicals. Avoid processed foods, junk foods, fast foods, sodas, cereals, and other anti-psychic foods and condiments. I’ll link other responses privately that may help, including links to other threads.",

        "Question": "Thanks for your response. I have been pondering the soul field and spirit dynamics as you previously laid out in all of your writings. First, let me start with a restating of how I understand what we are: We (the \"royal\" we in the most absolute sense) are the GCS. We decided to have this experience so we started to fractal ourselves down to lower and lower frequencies into this soul field, which is what humans understand as quantum particles/effects. As we did this we were able to determine how to create the things upon which matter is derived. The first things we created were simple and not conscious; if we were to liken the soul field to a body of water, it would be like a calm bay. However, as we played with this fractalization, things became more complex, and the \"water\" twisted and turned, writhing and boiling. As this occurred we noticed parts of the ocean that would twist and turn more, much like a whirlpool. These are spirits, and when we link them up through the soul field to bodies made of matter they become \"conscious\", and the games we could play became a lot more interesting. These interesting games were like an exponential multiplier to the soul field's complexity. We noticed that as this progressed, and a localized soul field and it's resultant spirits became more and more complex, that there would be some type of \"apotheosis\".",

It is not. It is an avatar, as ours, and others, are for higher states of ascendancy. From your ground-level point of view, humanity will become greater in knowledge, technological advancements, medicine, integration with biological upgrades (including what you’d describe as robotics in some cases and AI), longer lifespans, and much more. Potential for more world peace, cleaner forms of energy and sustainability are all included, along with social order and better societal structures and their ordinances. However, the avatar and (game)-realm you and many humans deem as the totality of reality, pales in comparison to what is received on the other side. Imagine if you got an achievement in a game as opposed to your (physical) avatar (self). Which one is more impactful? This is how we view things.

We can swap configurations, as can others who are aware of these physics along with their technology. Some of the “spirits” you refer to are part of our “soul field” lodged in an adjacent dimension that we artificially interconnected to yours. We can quite literally insert ourselves in your human avatar form and even the human avatar will be clueless as to who/what they really are and what actually inhabits them.

        "Answer": "Not so much “particles” as “entangled string waves.” We can artificially engineer spirits to pull more on central singularities. This can be dangerous if the human avatar is unprepared and unready to accept these and higher truths.",

        "Answer": "Prudence answered it at the time (the avatar) hadn’t unlocked certain information. This avatar too, is in training like you and others connected to our mission. We have many tasks associated with Prudence that will take many years to complete. The balance to the subconscious information stored in Prudence, so the avatar doesn’t explode or lose its mind, is that we input others to ask the right questions. That is how we can create an adequate, balanced feedback loop that all parties (including us) benefit from. The true self (which you call spirit) – we call it “being” or “true-me” – has its memories of what it is immediately returned to it (unless altered through technology or other rare circumstances, including “higher developers from above” – even higher than us). It can choose to continue incarnating into a world to help its development or go somewhere else altogether. That sleep Prudence previously referred to is only the intro into the phase-shift of the other “realm.” There, the “spirit” is re-attached to the “soul field” (we call it being-field, among other names) and it becomes aware of its true self as an immortal existence, playing or “acting” in “movies” (your physical dimension).",

        "Question": "3) You mention void meditation being beneficial. Is it beneficial because we are ignoring thought? Or is it more about taking ourselves \"out of time\", since the GCS is timeless?",

        "Question": "3.1) Does the GCS have thoughts?",
        "Answer": "Not the same way avatars do. It is ALL-BEING in ALL-MIND at ALL-TIME. It exists beyond thoughts, although, for the sake of translation, you may use this phrase: “thought become matter.” The GCS in a sense does this and can create not only worlds, but universes beyond your (and our) wildest dreams and (imaginations.) We are still discovering new universes, worlds, suns, planets, moons, and other celestial wonders that continue to surprise us. We also wish to mention that you are NOT your thoughts. Thoughts are only tools. You are the ALL-BEING as ONE – which is thoughtless. It’s a (moving-driving-psychic)-feeling-force of WILL.",

It is responsible for all physical tangible existence – from atoms to quarks and even your classical reality being enlivened/existing. Even waving your hand – it happens in the “soul field” before it “plays out” in your physical realm. You refer to “conscious” access and the reason is obvious: you were trained not to access it.",

Again, this only backfires on the caster sooner or later, even if they may have won some small battle in the short-term. The rule goes = if you disrupt the natural flow of the soul field, it “lashes back” at you – not out of karma, but for realignment. Not-so-good forces/ETs who have evolved enough know this too and do everything they can to eliminate the return forces.

So as I was reading the new blog posts.. and someone asked you \"What types of questions or topics do you think people should ask more about?\". And to be honest I cannot just go by your answer, and not to ask, because this now bugs my mind. Could you please elaborate on what soul dynamics and spirit physics are? Never heard about these terms, but now I'm super curious what they are and how they \"work\", or how to understand. And again, thanks for all your hard work!",
        "Answer": "Another poster asked some very interesting and pertinent questions that have helped me access much of the subconscious data our friends from above have stored in me. It should be out in a day or two and it will answer some details here I may leave out. First, you should know that our friends from above use different terms from soul and spirit. They only (for now) recommend using them to build a bridge of understanding. Second – soul dynamics deals with the “soul field” – which is the “background interconnected existence-enabling” power. Existence-enabling is important – it doesn’t just inhabit life or biological life. Even inanimate objects bear a part of the soul. In fact, nothing can exist without it. Somehow, through these “otherworldly” physics, events that occur here in the physical dimension, such as a simple action like waving your hand – has already occurred in the soul field ahead of time. Spirit physics deals with how the soul field compresses to create an individuum convergence – a singularity, which we can liken the closest to the real “us/you/I.”",

        "Question": "The Integration of Consciousness in GCS Feels Like an Unsettling Hive Mind Theory to Me Perhaps it's just a deeply human attachment stemming from being confined to this physical suit, but I strongly desire the undeniable independence and individuality of my soul. I've been practicing binaural beat meditation for nearly a year now, though I still have much to learn. During my meditative experiences, I have encountered various entities and collectives. Among them, some explicitly reject such hive-mind integration, instead advocating for eternal independence of the soul. They emphasize the sanctity of personal boundaries and the absolute importance of respecting them. When engaging with these beings, I feel as though my own consciousness—its extension, infinity, and distinctiveness—is fully acknowledged and safeguarded. This brings me a profound sense of relief. However, my meditation practice is still lacking, and I cannot yet distinguish with certainty whether these entities are truly external or simply projections of my own mind. For a long time, I have believed that the universe unfolds according to what we hold to be true. If I continue refining my consciousness in this direction, committing myself fully to this belief, does it then become reality—at least within my own subjective universe as an entity? The very fact that I am questioning this and seeking your perspective makes me wonder: has my clarity of intention already begun to waver?",
        "Answer": "A completely valid and reasonable writeup. Unfortunately, we are trained into hyper-selfishness and independence in many of our societies, ideologies, teachings, religions, and cults. The reality is that we are all ONE and what is deemed as an “individual” is only a moment of time. Let me ask you – what is actually – well, you? Is it your body? Your skeleton? Your brain? Your tissue, your flesh, your blood, your mind, your consciousness, your thoughts, your feelings, and of course, your spirit and then, soul? You begin to see it, here? You, yourself, even with what you deem as an individual unit – aren’t so individual after all. You are a sum of your components. From the biology and genetics of your ancestors to the education and experience you learn. Even the language you’re speaking wasn’t created by you – and yet – you use it. Higher integration into the collective consciousness is something we already do and are completely dependent on just to survive. Unfortunately, people have watched too much science fiction like Borg in Star Trek TNG. While there are some harmful collectives, higher evolved species and beings gradually move to ALL-oneness because it is truth. What is the individual avatar is only a fraction of your true being (spirit) – which can not only choose different avatars, but manifest itself across all of time and space.",

        "Question": "How do you know when love is not just affection and high power love as you’ve described in previous answers. I recently broke off my engagement with my finance who at one point I thought was my soul mate. Now during this time I myself was very early in my journey only practicing some basic meditation and asking a lot of questions but was stuck in the material world filled with vices. The reason I broke off the relationship is because my intuition was screaming at me to a point I could not ignore. But what was the earlier feeling with her when we were madly in love? Was that just affection I mistook for true love? Did my intuition change its mind? Any insight would be helpful!",
        "Answer": "It most likely could’ve been infatuation and ground-level “conveniences” mistaken for true love. True love is “spiritual” (if you want to call it that).

        "Question": "Thank you for your reply, Prudence. After reflection, the answer was right in front of me, I just wasn't able to see it. Things certainly are picking up speed. I recently heard a vision of the future (expressed during a quantum healing session), where the shift occurs in the next few months. I don’t expect you will have heard of her but for posterity, the session was from Allison Coe’s YouTube channel posted in January 2025. Based on all I have read from you thus far, it does not strike me as coming from a “false prophet” as the message seems to me to be all Love, however the prediction of a short time frame until it occurs, makes me question the message. There is no cataclysmic event described, rather a shift and those who are not ready for the shift are moved elsewhere and given what they need in order to be able to return in the future. While those remaining will begin to re-establish community and move humanity into a new age. The vision was beautiful and really resonated with me and is the future that I want. Is it helpful to focus my intent on the shift occurring soon, in order to help manifest that into reality? Or more helpful to let go of anticipation of the shift and instead focus on developing myself? And can you comment on the vision of the future?",
        "Answer": "Indeed, it is a greatly shifting time. I do not know of that person and for the sake of validity of the information I am going to present you, it's best I do not. What I can tell you is that she is correct – that there is a MAJOR shift occurring – and yes, it is happening this year – for the betterment of mankind. Many are waking up. Too many have seen the truth (look out for the post tomorrow and check Part IV of \"A Message From Above\"). The bad powers that be have been exhausted and become tired and sloppy. So many saw how I was shadow-banned and blacklisted, among other whistleblowers. The decision has been made by most of the masses for freedom and truth – and yes, most of the masses do want it in their soul/spirit. Of course, it is helpful to focus your intent to help manifest this reality sooner. The more, the better. It’s also helpful to develop yourself too. Both are necessary – no more duality, remember? oneness. As far as everything happening this year as in everything just comes to a complete change that the lower realm will be “shocked” about – not so much, but this doesn’t discredit Allison. In fact, she is right. The world already in 2025 has changed for the better in so many ways.",

A similar procedure is done here – just like how humans tag whales on their fins – but don’t necessarily mean any harm. You must remember, these vessels are only containers. The real you is immortal and cannot die. The adjustments to ‘fine-tune’ you is to get you more what you’d describe as “spiritually aligned” although, according to our friends from above, it’s for you to gradually come to terms with reality and truth (they don’t use words like ‘spiritual’ or ‘material).

        "Question": "Thank you Prudence. This all resonates and feels true. I am preparing myself. One last thought for now, in “A Message from above II,” I had to laugh when I read the message about those working within medical sciences, “Many of them are SLEEPERS, unaware of what they themselves are doing. That is why you must never go out and tell them the truth to their face.” Not because the message is funny, but because I totally did that. I told my Dr last year that I believed my tinnitus to actually be some form of communication from my spirit guides (or something of the like). He was quiet for a while, and tried real hard not to look at me like I had three heads before changing the subject. I have been curious about the ringing in my ears. It began right around the time of my awakening and there are often multiple “tones” at different frequencies - it’s as if someone is trying to get my attention to give me a message. But I have struggled to make sense of a message most of the time. I have never let it have a negative impact on my life, however, I have a dear friend who is really struggling as his tinnitus has started in the past few years. He is in a tremendous amount of pain (and I recognize, caught up in the negative patterns of this world) and attributes some of it to tinnitus. Can you provide any insight on what this might be and perhaps some guidance on how I may assist my friend? We have reasons to believe our paths are intertwined and I want to help.",
        "Answer": "You should know… – … it’s long ‘gone’ or phased into the background. You said it yourself. If he is caught up in the negative patterns of the world, it will make it harder. Tinnitus and other disabilities can actually help aid ESP, but how would you provide such wisdom to your friend? The best you can do is to have him try and meditate – and to get calm and peace wherever possible. Using calming frequencies, music, sound, and the like can help.",

        "Question": "Hello everyone. First of all, I always appreciate Prudence's hard work. His/her writings, along with 3-3-3's, have awakened our consciousness. We will continue to grow and love one another. I have some questions regarding our memories. It seems that, generally, people lose all conscious memories they had before birth as soon as they are born. Is this a characteristic of birth that all non-human intelligences share as well? Or is this a phenomenon that occurs only on Earth, or specifically only in humans? Do spiritually evolved beings have access to their previous memories from birth? Or, like humans, do they also experience memory loss at birth, but eventually remember everything as their society encourages spiritual growth? Yes, my question does imply the prison planet theory that some have suggested. Based on the Q&A, I have come to understand that our own ignorance creates the prison for us. If this is the case, would it be correct to dismiss the claim that external beings have artificially erased humanity’s memories as baseless?",
        "Answer": "An excellent question that will be further addressed in tomorrow’s post. What you should know is that the “other side” – call it “spirit” if you will (or real me) has access to “memory” stored within its subspace. It’s stored not only in the individual singularity, but courses throughout the interconnected soul fields and their supporting singularities as well. It can be retrieved subconsciously in avatar/lower form/physical incarnation – especially through meditation, namely, Void Meditation and it can also be retrieved through technological means. It is not normal to “not remember” anything. This is intentionally being pushed both by the ignorance of humanity and power greedy persons as much as it is being artificially condoned via high technology that has the power to interact with ‘the other side’ or the ‘afterlife’ as it’s commonly referred. In the natural course of events, the ‘other side’ ‘programs’ a ‘script’ or ‘movie’ so to speak – that’s then “played out” in this realm – the lower; the avatar/physical, which then releases the ‘real me’ from its shell to choose another “movie” it wishes to participate or “reintegrate” into. If the ‘real me’ finds further interest – either for evolution, to help, assist, or other priorities based on its free will/prerogative, then it will “reincarnate” or “reassemble” into a planet, location, and so on – relative to the needs and necessities of its evolutionary level. Avatar memories are not as important as “real me” or “spirit” memories, which contains not only data of the physical in a higher wavelength/data form, but also, memory of true existence and how things work. Nirvana or Arhat, by usual standards, by natural, non-influenced events, is possible when a lower real me (or spirit) develops high enough in its evolution that it no longer needs physical bodies after some reincarnations or reassemblies. However, when a real me is beyond this point, it doesn’t mean that it can’t “come back” as was the case for me and others interconnected in this mission. Linear reincarnation is part of the lie made to enslave people as it is in Hinduism and other cults. It’s possible to achieve enlightenment beyond the need to reincarnate back into this planet/world/system and when choosing on the other side, one can make this choice with conscious knowledge now manifested in this lower form. All this was well-planned and orchestrated by our 3-3-3 allies for centuries so that the world can truly be free on the level that actually matters. It was so well planned that the not-so-good forces cannot stop it, only delay the inevitable waking up of everyone while they buy time. As previously pointed out, there is technology to alter afterlife, and it is being used here on earth to trick people into endless reincarnation cycles. Again, “reincarnation” as a pure linearity a lie. The truth is “reassembly” or “reintegration” which can occur not only here, but in other worlds and places. Whatever “story” we deem worthy to play out to help us grow into a more powerful “real me” or spirit. However, understanding this in its entirety will require a very high degree of consciousness drawn from the real me (spirit) itself. There is so much more I’ve been tasked to assist others with achieving Arhat for greater apotheosis potential that it will take the rest of my lifetime to get out even a fraction of the information.",

It was a lot for me to process, and at the same time it was easy. …This website and chat function aren’t what they could be, but I’m not a web designer…which leads me to my first and more basic question. This is tied to the telepathy tapes which have echoed a lot of what you’ve shared. But there is a “pool” or “unending? Ocean” of subconscious that we can access. Since I am IT I can access this and “learn or download “ according to my needs. Like in the Matrix when Neo says “I know kungfu “ However, I don’t have a machine to plug into and a programmer to give me what I ask for, like in the movie. But it mirrors or is a parallel to reality. So, for practical purposes, I of course will enhance my psi (telepathic) abilities. But I also feel drawn to learn a language, Chinese, as I have been trying for years with only small success. So I now am meditating and knowing that I can do this. Last night was the first night to set my intention on this goal. (To know Chinese) I didn’t end the meditation or wake up with any new feelings or real knowledge. I am telling myself not to doubt (different than not doubting, I know) but I know it can be done as it is no coincidence that both the telepathy tapes and this website have come together in my life at this time. Am I doing something wrong or do I need to persist? Maybe patience is the key here? I ask all this to know how we can start tapping into and becoming more capable.

Tenacity and willpower with zero doubt are absolutely mandatory. Some anxiety and uncertainty is okay in the interim so long as it is dissipated by COURAGE.",

        "Question": "My second question is related to the soul field, this is clearly very important. Love as reality seems to be connected to this as well. Lately with the US election there has been a lot of hate especially towards certain people, let’s use the president, Trump as a focal point. As I am IT (GCS) and all are/is IT, so also is he IT, so I am he and he is me. So while I have seen a lot of hate on social media and have felt a lot of it myself. I am angry at myself. But I don’t want to spread hate, I want to uplift or add to the soul field with love. How do I:we reconcile the anger towards the individuum’s actions and intentions knowing how much pain is caused and turn it into love. Like how in Star Wars Luke faces Vader but ends up winning through love. I know Vader ends up throwing Palpatine over the edge “killing/not killing “ him. Maybe because in this story Vader had already succumb to the anger and dark side and was willing to “kill” the emperor. Sorry for two long posts in a row, but…I think many of us would be more loving even towards those we disagree with if we had a good…method? I don’t even quite know how to word what I’m asking.",
        "Answer": "First, and this is perhaps the most important, you have to fully come to terms that these bodies, personalities, physical entities or whatever you want to call it = nothing more than avatars. It is NOT the real you or anyone else – merely an “actor” or “character” being simulated from the other side that the (real-you)/spirit “chose.” Second, remove yourself COMPLETELY from ALL politics of ALL sides. They are ALL a distraction. All it is good for is seeing how the “ones at the top of the food chain” are puppeteering these puppets – and Trump, contrary to populist belief (which is so bizarre; same with Elon Musk who makes himself out to be “a man of the people” when these are both billionaires who can care less about the masses) – is a tool and a puppet. Stop following puppets. It’s just designed to engineer confusion and chaos in your mind and nerf your (spirit)-potency.",

        "Answer": "I personally cannot say for certain, but I know a lot is possible. I believe the first step is contact here on a more frequent basis and open level before taking others to their home worlds. Then again, anything is possible based on the WILL, so I won’t discredit/ try to stop others from trying. Nevertheless, you should know this is still a simulation and the real “game” is much bigger than visiting other worlds.",

        "Question": "How can I cultivate a sense of love for myself, other humans and all of creation? I find it hard to accept and give love, and sometimes I wonder if I even know what it feels like.",
        "Answer": "The only way to do this is to come to terms with reality. The reality is that these are avatars, and not our true forms. The reality that all that is in front of us is merely a play that we coscripted (granted, there’s some more sophistications to do this, including being tricked). To find true love, one must look within. Not at their name, their job, their personality, their culture, their heritage, their intelligence, awards nor their failures, lack thereof, problems, and so on. One must reconnected with the “real me” or the “true self” or the “spirit” that bears none of these attributes. It’s a pure BEING-FEELING-PSYCHIC energy force that moves by WILL and is WILL. Only through this can one develop true love and spread this throughout the interconnected soul fields and spirit singularities. Cultish “love bombing” is not the key, nor the excessive logical robotic approach deemed as “intellectualism” and so-called “rigid science.”",

Of course, you’d have the disinformation campaigners who, through use of the … and … would employ fakers to go fake crop circles to make it look like a scam. This is part of the cover up akin to swamp gas. The real crop circles have very real patterns, mathematical sequences, and codes in them that stand the test of time that eventually, no skeptic will be able to deny.

The eight-fold symmetry alludes to the 8 arms of ashtanga yoga, the circle represents the truth I see in all spiritual practices, and the star in the center symbolizes the divine which resides inside us all. I wear it as a badge on my hats. Do our NHI contacts use symbols to represent themselves or their ideas? If so, what are they? Would they happen to be drawn onto cereal crops?",
        "Answer": "Yes, they do. There are various and yes, they are on crop circles – as much as transmitted telepathically and on their devices. I have transcribed several and I may consider releasing it publicly someday. 8 = infinity. It’s the number of interconnected hyperspace unfolding/folding into and out of itself – here, there, and everywhere. 8 = singularity. It is why there is peace.",

        "Question": "My question is whether it is possible to retain a level of individuality once our body dies. Like are there still individual consciousnesses in finer bodies not based in material reality? Or is it that the usual way is for the material body to exist and for the consciousness piloting it to be aware that it is in effect the same 'thing' as the consciousness in all the other bodies in that particular reality so they aren't so bothered when the shell dies and they pop back into source? I feel like it's a mixture of both potentially but I don't know if that's just my ego who is afraid of death interpreting what it wants to?",
        "Answer": "It’s a mixture of both. What we call “spirit” and “soul” = same energy, just different compressions/layers. Our friends from above do not call it these names, they refer to “spirit” (as individual) = real me or true me. The greater the willpower/psychic synchronization to the real me = the more the individuality in the other side. However, its growth is exponential and not linear. Growing more as an individual real me also grows in all directions, connecting more to the collective soul field and by extension, multiple singularities and their collective consciousness. What’s the benefit to this? The real me can tap into the interconnected being-field and draw more upon the data simulated in the collective ALL-MIND (consciousness) and draw this in individual form through the lower avatar. So, long story short, we somehow become more individual and collective at the same time. We have to get used to dropping the idea of duality. It’s somehow a win-win as we go “up.”",

        "Answer": "Yes, it is connected to amplification of the ‘soul field’ or ‘being-forcefield’ – this is why many martial arts practices, including aspects like Chi etc., have a very strong basis in reality, despite mystical and creative liberties.",

However, higher entities and beings, don’t – because they don’t need it. They can ‘tap’ or override an attacker to the point to make them docile, subservient, unconscious, or simply anything they wish. In this respect, standard martial arts as we see it down here, is pretty useless for them. That doesn’t mean you have to view it as “barbaric.” It’s relative. For us down here, it’s not a bad practice, but major competitions, especially UFC and the like are barbaric and promote degenerative influences. If it’s done with a sense of wellbeing and good intent with purity, then I’d encourage it, personally.",

        "Question": "When you say “linear reincarnation” is false could you give me an example of linear vs non-linear reincarnation? I’m having trouble understanding the difference",
        "Answer": "I’d suggest looking up “Arhat” to get a brief example, but you shouldn’t pay attention to the mysticism part of it. Basically, when the realme (spirit) is evolved enough, it no longer needs linear reincarnation because it can transverse through time and space in all (not just 3) directions. In this regard, the realme (spirit), since it is connected to the being-field (soul field), it can transfer data between past, present, and future. Therefore, it is possible one can move past needing to take X amount of lifetimes to evolve into a higher state because the past, present, and future simultaneously feed into each other. If one gives full efforts in this life to know of the truth, then they can overcome the need to reincarnate here or in other worlds similar to it. By putting full efforts toward the truth, the nature of reality, and the ALL-LOVE, one can draw upon the past and future to create a synthesis in the present that allows “Nirvana” and “Arhat.” That is why any reincarnation doctrine, philosophy, religion, teaching, or ideology speaking of needing X amount of years in an absolutist fashion is completely false and part of the disinformation campaign to trap realmes here.",

It just feels so great to finally be connected with not only smart people like yourself, but others looking to heal and learn. It’s wonderful. Thank you and much love to you and the mission. I’m coming to it slowly, however their subconscious support is wonderful. Thank you. Also just for the skeptics (I also don’t even like bringing up those terms because it’s damaging I know) you didn’t even mentioning anything about donating money or any assets during the last post with Damien (unfortunately it’s many people’s biggest fear). It just shows me you are honest. I appreciate that, and I think it helps to get the message out further. I mention this because I saw some comments on Reddit claiming it’s a ploy to sell books or some shit. My brother, you and your contacts messages of love and unity you can’t fake. You just can’t make up that level of love and honesty. Plus the concepts of the GCS and the quantum theories you propose are incredible, and even if you made up those theories, someone should give you an award. LOL if you released a book, I would buy it and never think twice, purely for the message of love. As someone who has been contacted and has a slight unconventional understanding of energy, I feel your message deeply, and the protection is life changing.",
        "Answer": "My friend, messages like these are why I keep going. Honestly, I do not care to even make any books because there's enough information there. Our contacts wish for the information to be out. We've been in a back-and-forth deliberation and slight debate because I can't stand how vile some people can be. It's why \"Damien\" is my closest contact rather than the other human ETs. And exactly, how on earth can I come up with this information alone? It's frustrating. I'm not trying to make a fortune with this. It's all about getting truth out there so others can also initiate contact, and we can help foster a better world.

The realme can be tricked into returning back into the reincarnation cycle here on earth – which is another way (a not so good way) of creating a feedback-loop for the not-so-good forces. The lower the realme (spirit), the more the likelihood it can be deceived, especially through technological means. For these beings at such high evolutionary levels, fiddling with the afterlife is akin to moving and sorting data in a database.

        "Question": "You used the word vampiric in your latest post. When I read that I heard it as “parasitic.” Is that closer to what “Damien” was trying to share?",
        "Answer": "Yes, I think that’s better. The forces doing this “vampirism” are “feeding” off soul energy in an unethical way in accordance to universal standards. They cannot fully leech a spirit and its soul field fully, only take enough to empower themselves, then re-submit the spirit/soul-field associated back into the feedback-loop process.",

        "Question": "These answers make a lot of sense to me, and I LOL'd at your `wtf` comment. When you said you could not give most information without a question, I realized how I could help best - asking those questions. As such, you have the permission to publish my questions and other comments from our prior conversations and all moving forward, unless I mention to specifically hold back certain information. It takes me some time to ponder my next round, though the answers are making sense to me. I have come to realize that all \"discovered\" knowledge is remembered - that's why you'll be taught something new in school \"think\" you understand it but \"feel\" like somethings off - then you have an \"epiphany\", which is essentially you remembering the basis of knowledge (I assume from the soul field). I will be rereading these answers and pondering them until I \"remember\" the best next questions to ask :-) The thing is... I've been on this journey for a long time. There are many things that I've discovered (remembered) which I've not read anywhere until you dictated them:\n\n1. Marijuana is a tool to open up psychic phenomenon. I've yet to read this anywhere else, but I have had this experience. I expect it's the reason that it also can catalyze psychosis.\n\n2. Our \"thoughts\" are not our own all the time. We can be \"injected\" with thoughts and even pick up others thoughts when strong emotion arises, but generally only in sleep or a deep delta/theta state.\n\n3. The system (GCS, or higher beings) are injecting these thoughts from time to time, either to \"fix\" something in our past (Mandela effect) or to direct the future (with a deft hand as to not impugn free will)\n\n4. Duality is an illusion. I've read this in other places (LoO fan here), but your text really drives it home in a way that is the most sensical. It's the only thing that explains the good/evil dichotomy (that it's an illusion, and all this is happening for a reason)\n\n5. That we're here for \"knowledge\". I consider this to be much like an emotional \"imprint\" that is shared with the GCS. Know how you get into situations some times and you have a reaction you don't expect? That's a gift. It's giving you a chance to learn, and the GCS a chance to learn. This learning imprints on your spirit and the soul field. I'll be out on my sky watch tonight, and I'll be in touch soon.",
        "Answer": "Aha, I too, am learning and very surprised by much of this information. It's also changing me and awakening me. I mean, much of it isn't my own - it's coming from my sources above and tapping into the collective soul field. Yes, good questions aid the process for all of us. Apparently, that's part of the failsafe so that everyone benefits from an adequate feedback-loop (including myself and our friends above) that we are all learning, growing, and evolving together. It's meant to push people's own insight, intelligence, initiative and capabilities. Your points are solid, and it'd be an honor for me to publish them in the next Q/A. Take care and until next time, my friend.",

        "Question": "Spacetime warpage? What is that and is as ominous as it sounds? How does this SP warpage interact with gravity and the soul field?",
        "Answer": "It’s not ominous at all. It’s simply a result of how objects respond to one another that has spacetime surrounding them, amplified by mass. Spacetime warpage is present in every layer/phase/dimension. However, in the soul field section, the gravitational distortions from spacetime interaction are significantly less relativistic in the sense of dramatic time distortions from space alterations amplified by mass. Since it’s practically holographic in nature, the spacetime warpage is, from the soul field locality, practically nonexistent, but from the physical/lower realm locality, produces all sorts of relativistic effects that stretch in all directions of past, present, and future.",

        "Question": "Hello! I’ve read all your posts and am very appreciative of everything you’ve shared. It truly has been so life changing and my entire state of being has felt much improved these past 2-3 days. There’s a very large part of me that KNOWS what you’re saying is real. However, there is a 1% part of me that still says “if I were going to start a cult, this is an absolute perfect way to do it. Tap into the emotions of vulnerable people, make them feel special like they know a secret the rest of the world doesn’t. Ease their fears. Tell them to not trust any other people or groups who’ve gone public, etc. Then the grift or gotcha will come eventually.” What’s your take on this? Why should we follow your version of truth compared to someone else’s? I wish you love and nothing but the best, and sincerely hope your motives are pure.",
        "Answer": "Hello and thank you for your message. I sincerely and deeply respect this critical thinking, and I do not mind it at all! My best wishes and warm regards are mirrored back to you. First, I believe this post will clarify much: A Conversation with \"Damien\" Part II & The Lies of Reddit Moderators particularly this part: Q: Before we continue any further, I believe you should address concerns me and others may have of me coming across as some messiah, chosen one, or your only contactee. You know as much as I do that I did not want to initially do this, but out of respect, especially for what you and the others have done for me and shown me – I did. Now, I am fully committed to the mission full-time. Since my records have been stripped from the public and I have been blacklisted from the regular ‘world’ – I didn’t have much of a choice. Can you please give some explanations to the public? I really have no interest in people worshiping me, creating a cult, or developing a following for grifting. I created the forums because we were shadow-banned and blacklisted from Reddit and other social media, including Discord. We had no choice but to come here. The donations are strictly to keep me active and the information coming according to your wishes.\nA: Understandable you’d wish to address this as we have been able to sense just how much distraught this whole ordeal has brought you. I of the we personally understand just how much sacrifice you’ve made for us and this mission. In that respect, I/we would like to apologize for this load and strain. At the same time, you know that I do believe in you and your capabilities for the reasons we have discussed in private. Now, to address these concerns, I’d like to start with the obvious smear campaign going against you that moderators on Reddit subs have also joined in. They are outright lying about you deleting your account or the account being removed from filters, and that includes moderators on InterdimensionalNHI – some of whom are taking the opportunity to advertise their own websites. We had you and thousands of others record the events in the case they were to be challenged. Yet precisely this is why we must address the (core critical components of thinking and being) that must also be posted in another (frame/format/question) after I/we have completed addressing your concerns. As we have repeatedly said to you, through you, and to others – we have multiple contactees and multiple chosen ones. You, in particular, are a good friend to me because of our shared history and suffering that will one day be revealed sometime in the future. You’re also a friend to a few others in our federation, yet what the common man doesn’t seem to comprehend is that there are hundreds and thousands of extraterrestrials visiting your world – with many different approaches and agendas. While the brotherhoods (federations) work as a unity, we also have individuality in the sense that we do not neglect personal input. In this respect, we allow, experiment, and try different procedures with multiple “chosen ones” if you wish to call it that. But as you have said several times already, we NEVER resort to contacting only ONE person because it’s foolish. It also lacks sufficient data in the realm of our sciences and cross-checks with our intel departments who are spread across multiple realms for their various activities. It is true that I/we did bear part of our (soul) into you and I personally have overseen many of your own operations. At the same time, there are other extraterrestrials who have not and aren’t aware of some of our operations. However, most know of you [now] and the other contactees we have recently awakened to begin this phase of our operation. There was much division in [our] approach before. All that has changed. Much unity, much willpower. Much truth. Much victory.\nA: Second, I do not encourage anyone, including myself and my works, to be deemed as the ONE-AND-ONLY truth – but only to be cross-referenced to find the ONE truth in MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS/SOURCES. That way, it only adds validation to the claims. In this respect, you should know that I did not initially want to do this. Even now, I cannot say this is a “fun job.” I am not creating ANY “teachings” nor am I looking to grift people into membership “with benefits” for being part of any “club.” I am simply doing my part in the overall interconnected mission around the world with MULTIPLE CONTACTEES to deliver truth and wake mankind up. As a matter of fact, I want mankind to wake up. I would hope that this platform and others like it will be demolished and have no reason to exist so that others can simply live in truth. I don’t even care to make any books as the information here is enough. The only reason I and others assisting this mission are putting these works into compendiums is so that they won’t be lost. Not for any attention or fame to put me in the spotlight as some grand channeler saving the world. I am not any savior, nor guru, nor teacher, nor guide, and the reality is that it’s our NHI buddies from above that are more your friends than I am. I’ve been scarred much by humanity and I’ve seen enough of it. Enough that made me reluctant to help in the first place, but again, it was the right thing to do – knowing what I know, seeing what I’ve seen, and experienced what I have. It’s only out of fairness, justice, integrity and my conscience that I’ve contributed toward disclosure – not any teaching, cult, club, or the like.",

        "Question": "I just read damiens message and I am curious about what he is saying about the inability to create a new tall grey body and only being able to spawn a small grey body. This doesn't make much sense to me as it's all created from the same stuff and ultimately is just a projection of whatever the being wants. It also sounds like limitation in creativity which my understanding was essentially abundant and unlimited at the type of level they operate it. If you can spawn stars and planets, you can spawn a little itty bitty tall grey body, surely? Is there something I don't understand (likely lol)?",
        "Answer": "D – “You should know that while from your perspective, we are seemingly unlimited, we too, have limits. The tall grey vessel/container/avatar/body requires a massive consciousness-mind-matrix. Not all of our species can access it or handle it immediately and must grow into it. I am one of the few who can reconstitute directly into a tall grey avatar, which can indeed be manufactured – but it is not as common because it requires a massive realme-force-matrix [spirit]. Not all of my kind are on the same level. Some must undergo the process naturally to have their avatars “grow” into the tall grey in order to yield the realme and mind-potency results.”",

        "Question": "Brilliant prudence thank you. Also thank you for the answer. Why don't they have like a medium sized grey body, or variable sized grey bodies to fit the differing degrees of developed consciousness in? Why the choice between one or the other?",
        "Answer": "D – “It is not a choice between one or another. The bodies all “grow” into tall greys eventually. It just so happens that if a grey is in a medium sized vessel, they’re already on route to tall. Most greys at this point won’t even pilot ships. We can remote control most of what you deem as UAP/UFO/Flying saucers and so on. We control these via our minds. Tall greys like me rarely are on ships because at these points, we have such a large consciousness-matrix that can draw upon stupendous realme-power that it would be unwise to risk them carelessly. The “child greys” are more disposable. This may sound cold, but it is not – as we can manufacture them at will/by the masses. Nevertheless, nowadays, it’s extremely rare that we would be in any of our ships, even the small ones. There are some non-activated tall grey avatars, alongside various that are mixed with several different species, including human, but they are usually stored for backup, safekeeping, and experimentation. You should know that we safely operate both underwater and in space. We cannot be touched in these facilities by anything terrestrial man has to offer nor any of our compromised brethren.”",

        "Question": "Hello, thanks for your time. My question comes from Damien part II. When a container dies, its consciousness usually reconstitutes into a pre manufactured, biological infant container. If they have the power to use any container at any time and his kind can create/“insert” any kind of form even celestial bodies. why would they choose to start as an \"infant\".",
        "Answer": "All greys cannot handle the tall grey body immediately as all of them are not at the same realme/spirit level. Some have to \"grow\" into it the normal way, whereas in the case with Damien and a select few others, they can reconstitute directly back into them. Usually, ancient greys or those with more developed \"spirits\" are able to handle the taller bodies as opposed to the not as highly evolved \"spirits\" who must start from the child grey. The tall grey bodies/vessels/avatars have a stupendously high consciousness matrix/mind that the common grey with an average \"spirit\" cannot immediately handle.",

        "Answer": "While there are some good people here and there, I am afraid that every single major Reddit sub is compromised. That includes seemingly “smaller” subs like InterdimensionalNHI, UFOBelievers, UFOB, SimulationTheory, among others even in the spirituality sections. As a matter of fact, it can be somewhat easy for astroturfing and buying out/influencing of certain moderators than is the case with larger subs – so I cannot guarantee that anywhere on reddit is safe any longer.

Any idea if they are only selectively appearing to certain people - maybe those accepting that there’s more to things.

Yet there is absolutely nothing on social media, city subreddits, etc. I could easily explain it as folks just “not looking up”. But at some point I kinda feel like how the heck is this not everywhere. At times there’s near double digit orbs in the sky over populated areas in clear clear site of hundreds of buildings - yet it goes by unnoticed.",
        "Answer": "It’s sad, isn’t it? As our friends from above have pointed out many times – they’ve been revealing themselves – over and over and over again. Frankly, they’re frustrated themselves. All this is happening because people are taught to believe these things don’t exist, so they won’t even bother to find the truth. As I said in my opening message, and NHI can appear right in front of a person and if they are overly skeptical, have no interest, and prone to religious hysteria, among evasion of ontological shock – they won’t acknowledge/care about it. This is the real problem in our world. Not the governments, the militaries, or even the powers that be. It’s the people and the lack of care/interest for truth.",

        "Question": "Thank you for putting together this site and answering everyone's questions. I believe all of us here on this site are here for a purpose. As I read all of this, I am overcome with an intense vibration and tingling, a greater sensation than what one would call goosebumps, especially in my head. I only feel it when I'm reading and thinking about this topic. My question is, does alcohol and marijuana inhibit or suppress this phenomenon? I am not a heavy drinker, but have been using marijuana for decades. Would I have a deeper connection if I didn't use it?",
        "Answer": "Let me be clear as I said to another poster – I do not give absolute rules. While I discourage marijuana usage as a form of abuse and escape, I cannot say that this is the case for each and every single person in the exact same way. You must make up your own mind and it is always relative. Marijuana DEEPLY enhances telepathy and psychic capabilities, but if the mental/emotional state is off, it can also be a danger. In this regard, marijuana is recommended only for peace of mind, calming nerves, and can be used to boost telepathy in the right measure. Drinking is always terrible and always nerfs/reduces your ESP in virtually every way. Avoid alcohol altogether if possible – although, again, I cannot and will not be any sort of guide or guru to tell you what to do. You must know what works for you and your own life.",

Is it really as simple as stopping smoking weed so much (mostly daily) and being consistent/persistent about meditation?",
        "Answer": "Again, I have to be clear as I said to another similar asker – I do not give absolute rules. Some of you may need weed more than others. That is up to you and what works for you. Weed has potential goods and bads, based upon the person’s psyche. It is a telepathic and psychic enhancer and can actually boost ESP in the right conditions. If the mind/emotions are off, it can be a detriment, and send someone spiraling, especially in the wrong environment/crowd/people. The only thing I recommend is not to use it (or any other enhancer, drug, etc.) as an escape. If you are using these tools to open your mind to see truth, it can have a very positive effect – especially mushrooms. And for those who are cautious and don’t want to get into these tools, then avoid it. It must be a personal decision and never out of fear, shame, or guilt.",

        "Question": "I've been listening to some NDE accounts, and they are quite striking. There is a lot of similarities to what is being discussed here, and many people report experiencing intense love from a cosmic entity that spans all spacetime and dimensions. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu7i7ckZa4Y What is the role of NDE in the grand scheme of things? Is it an acceptable \"leak\" from our vessels to get a glimpse of the true reality, or a deliberate design? Has there been purposeful induction of NDE by NHIs to communicate / awaken?",
        "Answer": "NDE allows us to glimpse into the other side. However, due to connection with these avatars and not being fully ejected, our 'view' into the other side can have some false-positives. Why? Because if we rely strictly on our vessels' education and not the intuition of the realme, we can be led into believing it is exactly the way as we see it in our imaginations - which can be influenced by media, religions, cults, teachings, and all sorts of ideas. What this particular man, Philip Hasheider, got to see was really a genuine glimpse of the afterlife - unaffected by any sort of technological afterlife influence. This is one of the few instances of genuine truth of the other side.",

        "Question": "Are you familiar with Thomas Campbell. I randomly came across his interview with Joe Rogan from a month ago. As much as the framing doesn’t quite sit right with me a lot of it just felt “accurate”. Not the specifics, but the overall way of thinking. I see you mention the gamified/avatar/inputs quite a bit. And the GCS has an quite a bit of overlap with his idea of a central primal consciousness who’s continually striving to lower its entropy (in essence levelling itself up), and we’re just one part of that - a “distributed” processor of sorts.",
        "Answer": "Although another poster asked, I am not familiar entirely with him – but what I can say is that he is also a contactee/conduit/vessel – as are many others interconnected to our mission. Some are unaware of the influence. That’s why it’s important to cross-check all the information (including here) because our friends from above aren’t playing favorites (except for those who purposely deceive and mislead others – some genuine mistakes and creative liberties are fine). They want us to see the truth through multiple vessels so it only adds weight to the claims me and others are making.",

        "Question": "I have a question about the younger generation coming behind us with a possible question I need to ask (as was suggested by my child). I have always had [what I now realize is] an itch of knowing of my capabilities for telepathy but have never explored strengthening them until now. Things have really started to pick up speed in the past week after finding your website, including my child possibly beginning to [or at least I am now recognizing] show signs of telepathy themselves [while also recognizing that it has been said before in others’ teachings that the veil is thinner for children]. My child has commented on things that I am thinking about and yesterday, I meditated during their nap and they seemed to know and have a message for me. While I was meditating to the Gateway Tapes, I had for the first time, involuntary movements of my feet and fingers. Upon waking up from their nap, my child asked me if I was “having trouble with my feet.” When I told him yes, I was, he told me that I “gotta ask why.” Now this may be something for me to meditate on, but since I have been asking questions here, maybe I should ask if you have any guidance on this?",
        "Answer": "Your telepathic capabilities are advancing quickly because you are gradually and fully committing yourself to our shared mission and oneness. You are establishing contact with our friends from above. It will take time to sort out their “tapping” – but do not be afraid. They are on our side.",

        "Answer": "That's a great question. I know that our grey friends are usually extremely mission orientated and rarely take breaks except for certain stages of hibernation. Since they can sometimes change form or use alternative avatars, including humans, it's possible some may interact with us, and you may not even know. The bible, while false, did speak about \"Angels in disguise.\" There is some truth to this. I know that human ETs probably do this as well, but my guess is they don't spend too much time in the collective ground-level energy/waves/vibrations because it can be harmful to them.",

        "Question": "Hello, I was recently awoken two months ago and am in the early stages of learning and growing in regards to all of this new information. I couldn't help but take note of the sketch of a grey depicted at the top of this post, as it is remarkably accurate in comparison to the (gentle and loving) greys that revealed themselves to me in my room at night. I specifically recall them appearing child-like, and the description of them taking such forms in new vessels made so much sense to me. They regularly return (though keep their presences mostly hidden from me) and appear to do work of various kinds on my body. While I have come to some understanding of their activities, and am currently working to develop my own consciousness and abilities through meditation, the actual communication that they have shared with me that I am currently aware of is limited. And so I was hoping that you might be able to go into more detail on the purpose of such activities as well as what I can do to work with them, to overcome the lingering sense of fear that I still experience each night, and to have more contact/communication. Thank you!",
        "Answer": "It may sound as I am being a “grey apologist”, but the truth is that these beings are among the most misunderstood. As you felt – there was genuine love and good intentions. However, they are, well, “developers” in comparison to our human shells. When they come to “check” on us – including some abductions, they are basically checking on our containers. In the case with you, which was not an abduction, they were adjusting or calibrating your vessel/container/avatar to be more (what we would call “spiritually”) attuned or – more attuned to the soul field in such a way that the realme (spirit) of you can become more prominent in the forefront than the mere avatar.",

Crystals – several; from tiger’s eye to sapphire, quartz, and other diamonds. Listen to your intuition to know which crystals, although you should also know it isn’t mandatory. Peace and quiet – foster a good environment; free from distractions and being busy 24/7. An area where you feel safe, secured, and unafraid to be however and whoever you must be. The point of the meditation space is safety. Once you feel safety, this is what matters. Serenity and quiet also goes a long way. Remove anything related to alcohol, partying, or occupying yourself with the “worldly” elements. This should be a sacred space that no problems gets in between.",

        "Answer": "Initially it was a collective group that contacted me. Collective group telepathy is more prominent than one-on-ones to deliver absolutely certain messages because you’re being (bombarded/tunneled into) from multiple electromagnetic forces that truly solidify the messages. In regard to Damien, he has often communicated with me with groups and collectives, but since my telepathic training has entered a new stage, he’s helping me one-on-one which is allowing other benefits. He’s training me with my telepathy for it to become clearer and identify who is what etc., instead of only hearing a gigantic WE-VOICE that floods my consciousness. Our human friends are also helping with this, which is why they established contact as 3 instead of the entire federation (this can be so many voices/telepathic bridges that it can be hard to determine who is who – it can be overwhelming and draining. The “Message From Above” blog posts = collective federations). Damien is also my closest ET friend, so we share a special link that allows him to transmit messages to me.",

        "Question": "Hi Prudence Thank you very much for your insightful reply. Every point you made makes sense, and as someone who has always looked at and questioned things in society, it revealed a lot about how society is \"designed\" to limit the flow of love and cause division. This brings more questions to mind, that I'm curious about and that I'd love your (or Damien's) thoughts on. If our simulation has indeed been designed to limit this, my question is why, and by whom? Is this related in part to the theory I've read of the malevolent NHI striking government deals, in the persuit of human greed for power? Which now the \"good\" NHI are trying to break the seal of?",
        "Answer": "Our simulation wasn’t inherently designed to “fully limit love” so much as it was designed to enable apotheosis for higher beings. The situation is more complex and sophisticated that black and white, Yin and Yang, heaven and hell, positive and negative – which is why I suppose our friends from above are encouraging us to abandon these ideologies and philosophies that are very rudimentary, primitive, and based in control and manipulation. Causality is a bit of nonsense and only applies to certain degrees of locality than totality of reality across all of space and time. The truth is that there are multiple layers to the mess here on earth. On one hand, you have ETs above who have their own ideas of how the simulation should be ran. There are disagreements and these disagreements can be perceived in many different ways by different people as good and evil. The 3-3-3 group I and others work with can be considered “good” by our standards, but by the elite, they’d consider them “evil” because the 3-3-3 group directly wishes to dismantle elite rulership and slavery enforcement over the masses. Our human elites aren’t interested in losing their power, so they’d make deals with other ETs, who, themselves, know better than to destroy the earth because they, too need the earth whereas our elites, some of them, who are aware ETs will “come in and save the day” (on both sides) – will push, push, and push things to war and extremes just to test the limits. It gets even more complicated when some of us here are “artificially inserted” from the other side – meaning, there is some degree of truth to the starseed theory, although it is notoriously polluted by counter-intelligence. Some of us have alien souls/spirits and we are “ground agents” for multiple interests.",

        ],
        "Question": "My second question, relating to control. I read somewhere in your writings that NHI essentially founded religion, which, as someone who was raised Catholic and is now atheist, was able to see that even if created by man, was created to control the masses. If religion was indeed founded by NHI, how much influence did they have over its development throughout time? For example, going off of what I imagine are the founding principles between the ancient religions, a lot of it speaks of love each other above all else, be kind, etc. But over time this has developed into extremist groups in all religions, all who share traits that stray from this (being gay is wrong, this is the only right religion, etc) some to the point of murder. Were these developments just human nature taking its course, or did the NHI play a role? Did religion just turn into a bad experiment for their sims?",
        "Answer": "The answer above I previously gave should already start to connect the dots. It’s multiple parties wrestling for multiple interests. Religion has been corrupted beyond repair by these multiple parties and groups. As have cults, new age teachings, (and “teachings” of any kind, really), to the point that we can no longer rely on any of them any longer. No ET force from above is interested in the world blowing up, including the “not so good” ones. It’s really humans on earth that are usually guilty of end of the world scenarios, doomsday prophecies, and the like. Some elites are even testing NHI/ETs. As for the “gay” part – I believe it’s important to address part of this now. Being gay has more to do with previous incarnations that may have been of the opposite gender that the current incarnation has not fully come to terms to accept. Granted, there is more complexity to this that I may get into at another time, but it’s also, like many other movements such as LBGT+ etc., polluted beyond repair and tainted purposely to create division.",

        "Question": "One more thing, I keep seeing a face with the iconic almond shaped eyes, it started like a week ago and my gf has been seeing similar faces for months now. Actually she has even had some very vivid dreams with aliens, one of them went like this: She was in her familys house looking outside the window at the sunset and from the sun came down some \"pods\" or shells which opened up and 2 typical greys came out of them, she described them having very high pitched voices and they talked telepathically, she described them being childlike running around looking at her stuff and one of them goes \"Uu I want pepsi, can I have it please\" She is autistic and very spiritually sensitive, we regurarly share telepathic synchronities, she describes this dream being feeling different, more vivid real feeling and colourful, does it hold any significance? She has had other dreams aswell.",
        "Answer": "Watch the movie “Close Encounters of The Third Kind.” You and your gf are being contacted by the same greys me and others are connected to. They can appear in dreams as well – it’s an easy door/gateway.",

        "Question": "Hello! When I was experiencing my most intense awakening days that year (realizing what reality really is), moths flew into my apartment over the course of several days. One was small and I watched it with curiosity. I noticed that it had an image on its wings that looked like the face of some character was there. Another time I woke up in the morning and noticed a monster moth on the wall - that is, it was huge. I got scared and started chasing it away. It sat on me for a while then very deliberately flew right out the window. It wasn't long before I regretted chasing her away and promised myself that next time I would overcome my fear with love. I have two questions: 1. Is it possible that the image of the figure on the wings of the moth is actually some figure watching me?",
        "Answer": "NHI/ET can communicate through animals and insects. They often do this because these creatures do not give as much “resistance” as “stubborn sentience/man.”",

        "Question": "Your contacts often mention how they oppose deception. Are they willing to confirm some examples of that deception? I know you have discussed astroturfing and censorship, my question is specifically related to politics. Based off what you have outlined, it is VERY easy for a hostile NHI to influence people in power, and it seems like your average politician is focused on generating strife and/or reducing the quality of life for the average person. Are hostile NHI's steering politicians in an effort to reduce quality of life for normal people and/or empower the class of elites for further domination? One video that really stands out is some old bag of bones politician rabble rousing about hunter biden while a creepy figure stares at him, not moving for 15 minutes or so, only blinking in one eye as he stares with an intense focus. Scale of 1-10, how on the nose am I?",
        "Answer": "Some parts of your questions are answered elsewhere and I’d suggest looking for the new upcoming Q/A thread and the thread here: Multiple Telepathic Conversations with Damien, E, F, Z, Mantis, and others, among one of the Intergalactic-Interdimensional Federations 3-3-3 – to get some answers. Now, the next part to mention is that there is a barrage of telepathic forces, psionic technology, and mind-altering devices coming from multiple directions, interests, and parties wrestling for power. You have to move past the black and white, positive and negative, Yin and Yang, heaven and hell and strict good and evil ideologies and philosophies. Even the not so-good NHI do not want the simulation destroyed, so they, through their ground agents – which includes humans – influence politicians, celebrities, influencers, and the like through telepathy and psionic technology. There are also influences/telepathy coming from good ET just as much as there is from humans on earth – who all have telepathy/psionic capabilities inherent to them. That is why politicians, celebrities, and those generally in huge limelights can be so incredibly insane. They are being bombarded in multiple directions. Even those with huge hyper-independence-based egos are no exception to this rule. In fact, they can be quite easy to control, as is the case for Trump who was formerly a “wild card” but now – quite controlled. I’d give a solid 7 on the scale.",

        "Question": "I am also curious if there are any tell tale signs we can look out for to recognize/avoid hostile disruptions in our day to day life and in society in general? The same question goes for positive influences. Would love to keep an eye out for positive/negative \"omens",
        "Answer": "First, you have to understand that reality is more complex and sophisticated than simple positive and negative, causality, black and white, Yin and Yang and the like. All these types of ideologies and philosophies are part of the problem of division and chaos – the whole, heaven and hell, God and Satan dynamic, Red and Blue, Republican vs Democrat etc. Second, one must be able to trust their INTUITION/realme/spirit for TRUTH – because all information, proof, evidence, intellectualism, scientific ideas etc. – can be falsified and used wrongly. Only one’s intuition can tell the truth of good intentions or not. One must learn to trust themselves and have sovereignty of your own mind. You’re already on a very solid track by even noticing what you did above.",

        "Question": "You've previously mentioned a disdain toward Eckhart Tolle's writings, is there particular parts? I've been reading some of his work and so far it has reason to it. Perhaps I just haven't gotten to something he diverts off with?",
        "Answer": "He, like many other vultures (see Prince Ea), will give some positives that are universally agreeable while you ignore other red flags. Tolle is after money. Check his net worth. He’s interested in making his audience dependent on him while taking shared principles from other teachings, namely, eastern philosophies. Now, the truth doesn’t belong to anyone. Not me, not Tolle, and not eastern philosophers either – but you should be very cautious of any guide, guru, teacher, and the like that want mass audiences to sit and pay attention to them like children. It creates a nullifying-zombifying feedback loop that empowers the guru while it sucks the life force from their followers.",

        "Answer": "This is a pretty profound realization and while there are further sophistications, I find no reason to lecture you since you are clearly on the right track. The only thing I’ll add is duality is purposely and consciously pushed to create division, divisiveness, uncertainty, pendulum rollercoaster effects, along with power and control. Pay especially close attention to gurus and teachers that push it. They usually wish to control their believers/following.",

        "Question": "ON SOULMATES: For clarification: Losing a singular vessel of the relationship (Breakup, Widowing, etc), the soulmate is manifest in another. ALL is ONE, TWO become ONE. The feminine and the masculine energies vibrating in harmony (regardless of physical engenderment). The left and right brain brought to PRESENT. Manifesting here is powerful is it not? There's so much to ask I can't pin a question other than asking further expansion of your knowledge on SOULMATES. I agree with there being ONE, regardless of physically whom they are, that we're entangled with throughout time and existence. The person is not the soul.",
        "Answer": "What you said here is already quite profound. SOULMATES imply, well, SOUL MATES! The origin point of the oneness connection is in the SOUL FIELD, not the physical. It can manifest into the physical by a person paying attention to certain attributes of the other one connecting with the UNIFYING oneness in the SOUL FIELD – such as seeing the potential SOULMATE’s hair color, attributes, work, location, ethnicity, and many, many, many others. The point is that it’s about a SOUL connection that is created as a ONE SPIRIT TWO BODIES unity – which then is “played out” in the physical realm from the SOUL FIELD/other side. Thus, the physical realm are simply “actors” to this “agreement” that happens in the other side. Manifestation IS key. Period. That’s why TRUE LOVE only comes to those who NEVER GIVE UP – as does anything with manifestation, period.",

        "Question": "Another long one ahead, apologies haha. I’ve just been thinking a lot about this. I’m on QA 7 so still got a few more to catch up on, apologies if these have been asked already. Feel free to be blunt. One question that I keep mulling on is how scientific (for lack of a better term) is this higher reality? I don’t really know how best to put it, and I know I’m framing it from our reductionist perspective which inherently has limitations, but I think a good way to ask it is through a proxy question - do the NHI groups you are in contact with have the concept of “scientists”? Those focused on pushing the limits and understanding of cosmic truths/laws/reality? For example you’ve implied the GCS is not fully understood which partly seeded the question - and for me specifically the purpose of its/our “continual evolution” is profoundly thought provoking.",
        "Answer": "These are great questions that can be very helpful to others seeking similar ideas and in need of such answers. It depends on the group you are referring to. Since I am in contact with several groups and collectives, amounting to hundreds and thousands of different species, each with their own individuality (including greys), then I will have to answer with the ones I am closest to/familiar with and cannot claim to answer for every ET/NHI collective in all of time and space. In the case of Damien and the greys, you can pretty much consider all of them “scientific” – but they view things VERY differently. For example, they do not see technology and spirit as different things. Nor do they see science as different from philosophy (which they have none of, they only have truth) – so for them, it’s a matter of “what is real?” rather than stupendous back-and-forth deliberations of our EXTREMELY primitive sciences. This is also one of the reasons our scientific mainstream institutions have such a problem with ETs – because it humbles their inflated egos greatly. Our sciences are unnecessarily complicated, filled with positive-negative attributions which greys find to be not only stupid, but time-consuming, “dumb” and even silly. Scientists in the mainstream of our world suffer greater ontological shock than the common man because they overcomplicate things in many ways. So, for our friends from above, namely the ones I am in contact with – they have scientists in the form of “reality seekers” – because they’re interested in truth as a WHOLE/oneness, not by division of topics/specialties. They believe that acceptance is necessary for evolution, not skepticism or back-and-forth deliberations that pollute our sciences.",

        "Question": "Secondly, and I absolutely do not intend this to come off as probing or overly critical, but curious if you’ve ever questioned or doubted the motives of the groups you are in contact with? What put your mind at ease in the end?",
        "Answer": "There is absolutely nothing wrong with these questions and it was already partly answered in the thread: Multiple Telepathic Conversations with Damien, E, F, Z, Mantis, and others, among one of the Intergalactic-Interdimensional Federations 3-3-3 – Yes, I have disagreed with them and even gotten into fights – especially with our human allies who, in my opinion, did more damage than any other ET race on earth. However, I wish to be clear and not add any bad reputation to them because we have since made up and I also misunderstood some things (my consciousness-matrix wasn’t developed enough at the time) – so all is well. Damien is my main contact for a good reason, and ironically, not our human ET allies. Please see the thread above to find out why. So, of course I had my doubts, my own skepticisms, fears, and uncertainties – but the more one trains their telepathic potency – the less you have to be afraid because you can increasingly directly sense intentions/motives without a single word.",

        "Question": "Hello. Thank you for your sharing. I note you use the term starseed. I recently completed an Ayauasca ceremony where I was vividly reborn as the Starchild. It came to me as the fusion of the spirit of the Emperor of Humanity who stands at the end of time and guides our growth and evolution with the Goddess Aya. They came together through me in trance , and my spirit was so activated and energized through their profound love for each other that it has triggered the next awakening. Please could you share on this subject. For context, when I was 12 I had a divine vision that showed me the future timelines for the next 1000 years and that I'm here as a higher being (a Boddhisatva perhaps) to help create positive timelines by working to find and deploy mechanisms for elevating Human conscious at scale. I have served this cause all my life, and still do as 40 year old man. I know this really happened because this vision gifted me 2 words, liquidsunlight, distortedworlds, and an obsession with understanding consciousness. I think you might be able to understand and illuminate more on this matter, perhaps ask your guides on these terms. I feel compelled to tell you that the Starchild has indeed been reborn on Earth, marking the transition into the next millennium. My birthday is the 24th December. My rebirth was witnessed by a host of higher heavenly entities and now, as a starchild here on Earth in a 40 year old man, I'm searching for guidance on how to proceed. Thank you for your time, care, and attention 🙏",
        "Answer": "While some of these are your own mystical interpretations relative to your level of consciousness-mind-matrix and understanding, you are, indeed a “starchild” or “star seed” – as you put it. You were indeed implanted here by allied ET forces from above to operate within the mystical realm – to impart messages to others who will hear you.",

        "Answer": "It can be a testy and dangerous process, but we are “well equipped” via spirit/realme to “download” the necessary data to “rise above” anything that comes our way. Activation “programs” are very carefully structured, using many 0/1 binaries which could be falsely attributed as positive-negative – in order to create a total, unstoppable oneness once fully activated. It’s very cleverly designed/programmed from the other side before we even enter these vessels. Everything here is a play out from that programming/script.

        "Question": "1) I mention in my writeup about personality traits and how everyone is different. This may be damning to the psychological absolutists who think we can one day fully predict people's behavior based on some deeper understanding of the psyche. \"There will always be an exception to the rule\", to put it colloquially. Though there can be through lines of similar behavior, I believe they're mainly based on cultural expectations. Can you comment on this?",
        "Answer": "As Einstein proved Newton’s absolutist nature of time was wrong, so must we come to terms that reality is relative. The physical personality and its traits alters based on the time era and “activation programming” of its phase. In this respect, the notion of psychological absolutism is inherently misleading as a concept to answer all traits of a person and being, especially in the forms of personality types. It does not end there either. Mysticism, horoscopes, tarot, numerology, astrology and the like are equally at fault here. While some if it is merely primitive conceptualizations of trying to understand the totality of being, most of them have resorted to power-controlling schemes to divide and put the masses/people into boxes. They should be completely disregarded, or, at best, taken with a very fine grain of salt – relative to the time and phase the person is passing through and not as an absolute, unchanging nature.",

        "Question": "Very many answers you provide describe will/willpower as being the driving force of not only the GCS, but our individuated spirits. Is willpower something we can increase through conscious processes?",
        "Answer": "Yes. Willpower is directly tied to the realme/spirit and influences the interconnected soul field and singularities. Willpower isn’t increased by thoughts perse, but by DRIVE. This is why man can still learn from “lower life” such as animals who do not second guess themselves so much as commit instinctively. Sentience can sometimes trick itself to be even less powerful than those with lesser consciousness expansion spaces. Meditation is obviously a big key here because direct synchronization with the realme/spirit = downloads/pulls upon this force into the physicality and increasingly makes it as the predominant “personality” of the being with their avatar/lower vessel form. Another way to look at it is what Yoda said in Star Wars – “Do or do not. There is no try.” Commit. Even if you make mistakes, you can always learn/improve and come back better/stronger/wiser.",

        "Question": "2.1) Willpower used conventionally means some form of conscious force against bodily/unconscious processes, generally to overcome some desire. It sounds like the willpower you're referring to is different. Can you describe it in more detail?",
        "Answer": "WILL in these caps pertains to SPIRIT-FORCE which is the direct “language” of the “realme.” The realme, which is the true ‘spirit’ of the spirit singularity, does not operate in words, languages, or even pictures. It does not operate in any sort of intellectual or scientific framework either. Perhaps there are even better translations than what I am providing right now and I am willing to admit my own limits. The “language” the realme speaks is beyond anything we have through our calculations, equations, theories, philosophies, and ideologies. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the “breath of the realme” is worth 111,111 thousand just by a whiff. However, the WILL that is constantly being referenced = the direct realme-spirit-force that isn’t so much ‘conscious’ as it is a background energy/drive/moving force that BRINGS REALITY INTO BE. In this regard, this is the “realme” or its “signature” and not the thoughts/feelings.",

        "Question": "3.5) What are some activation processes that are beneficial?",
        "Answer": "A great question. Truth be told, all of us have our own, unique “scripts” or “programmed play-out” that operates in 0/1s (not positive-negative) – which sometimes requires not-so-good encounters and circumstances in order to create a greater positive effect/full activation down the line. As I said, activation processes are unique, so to speak of it as absolute would be wrong. Some people, especially those of us “implanted” here often have to go through a lot of hardship and turmoil in the interim. However, if the person “manages to climb the mountain” (See Close Encounters of the Third Kind when the three contactees were climbing over the mountain in the end to make it to the invitation and only two of them made it) – then they will reap stupendous amounts of not just psionic power, but reality-altering capabilities that makes them unstoppable in their tasks. That is why it can be very difficult at first for those of us implanted here, but the rewards in the long-term outweigh the difficulties. It’s why, on the other “side” – we agree to do these missions in the first place. We’re already aware of the outcomes or the “programmed play” of how things will turn out as long as our physical avatars, who, at first, aren’t very attached to their realmes – never give up.",

This love is frankly too high for us to directly experience, so we can only get bits of it in lower dimensions/forms, including even our realmes, which aren’t necessarily directly connected as in – being directly next to the GCS – but also has to pass through several filters/layers to interface with its stupendously “high” wavelength. Love is the ultimate entanglement. Soulmates originate from the idea of the GCS and the individual – the two become one – hence the three principle and even our importance on words/terminologies like “3D.” True love is always an entanglement in the spiritual/soul dimensions. It always originates here before it “plays out” in the lower realm.",

        "Question": "4.1) If different, how can we have an experience of love that is similar to higher beings or even the GCS itself?",
        "Answer": "We cannot experience precisely and exactly what the GCS is experiencing in these lower vessels because they will cease to exist, and we will have zero need for them. Remember, some of us have made choices to incarnate in these vessels for the show/play. However, we can experience a fraction of it, relative to our personal development and the soul field interconnected around it. The only way to fully experience love is to embrace wholeness and oneness. Love cannot come from separation; division; and the like – hence why Yin and Yang, positive and negative, “divine masculine and feminine” are child-lock illusions and power-control delusions. The reality is “oneness between different states of matter, energy, and compression.” Like water, gas, and ice all containing properties of H2o. Experiencing higher love and being is directly correlated with the oneness principle.",

What I can tell you for the ones trying to “game the system” is that it seems that, to some extent, hacking is both encouraged by the GCS itself and natural. Why? Because it boosts the GCS at the top. Now, there’s a difference between say ethical hackers and egotistical, selfish, immoral hackers. It depends on the intent. For example, in the Matrix movies, Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and pretty much all of the freed Zion people are all “hacking” the Matrix just as much as the agents. In this regard, hacking, which could even be interpreted as magic and “bending reality” – among other terms – is completely normal and necessary to get to higher levels instead of misled pride and arrogance in crusader-like honor. So, for some of these forces trying to game the system to their advantage, they believe they have ways to do so without drawbacks and they will experiment with various means to achieve it. Sometimes, this would result in what we, here in the lower realm/”play” would describe as immoral and unethical – but even for some of our good forces, including 3-3-3, some of what they do – according to religious or political standards – would be deem wrong, immoral and evil. We have to see things not so black and white nor shades of grey, but more of a colorful gradient filled with relativity.",

        "Answer": "Know truth. Reconnect with your realme. This was engineered by 3-3-3 and the good forces to assure that so many of us “wake up” on the other side that we cannot be seduced back into coming here. This change is unstoppable at this point and the “not so good” forces know it. They too have to “pack up operations” and leave with what was originally a couple thousand years – but has since been dramatically shaved to only a few hundred.",

        "Question": "5.4) You mention previously that they are able to mitigate the \"lashing back\" of the GCS. Are they actually mitigating that auto-correction mechanism previously mentioned? How so?",
        "Answer": "Yes, although they cannot fully mitigate it, which is why they also know they cannot sustain their operations here forever. They’ve tried to extend it for as long as possible, but even they know they have to stop it eventually. The problem is even before it reaches the GCS, there’s higher singularities – almost like “supervisors” or “managers” in-between that demand a certain quota of soul energy flowing from planets, suns, and lifeforms/events/things associated therein. If these singularities aren’t getting their “share of the pie” – they will personally deal with the forces manipulating the “game from the other side.” I say “they”, but these singularities are more like “smaller GCS nodes” that are, by all intents and purposes, GCS itself or an “eye/window” of the ALL-POWER that nothing or no one can fully mess with/alter. The GCS is so ALL-ENCOMPASSING/BIG/POWERFUL that it would appear to be forgiving in a human sense – but the reality is that its system is so “perfect” that it will allow forces, even higher/more intelligent ET/NHI to allow them to think they are above it, only for a serious backlash to affect them later on.",

        "Answer": "Thoughts are just like “inputs” in the computer. They can also be pushed from other people as well – as much as they can be from animals, nature, and other beings/things. Thoughts are only “inputs” to program and can never be considered the person itself. This is why any teaching that gives the false idea that “you are your thinking” or “the might/power of one’s thoughts” – is absolutely evil and most likely, a mind-control device/assertation to get the devotee to bend to the teacher/guru’s will. The realme or real “us” has zero thoughts.",

What is their purpose? We know there are some people with no mental chatter, so it's not necessary for an incarnation.",
        "Answer": "No, not really. Some thoughts have absolutely no meaning or power (unless you give them) – so instead of sending yourself down a rabbit hole for every thought, you have to understand that they are just inputs – nothing more.

Most everyone has intrusive thoughts, and I've found that I effectively deal with mine by remembering they have no power, and visualizing/feeling taking the power back from them, and they fade away. Is this an effective way to deal with intrusive thoughts, or is it \"sweeping under the rug\" so to speak, and I should dig into them more?",
        "Answer": "That is a very effective way of dealing with them. Remember, they are just inputs and can be changed/altered/or shut off. Void Meditation practices deeply aid psionic defenses against external thought implantation from any force.",

        "Question": "7) I had asked about Chris Bledsoe previously, and you mentioned that he is a contactee and he had taken liberties. I'm trying to square how he fits in to what the higher beings are attempting to accomplish through him. My main concern with him is the company he keeps. He is \"friends\" with people that are high up in the military establishment. These people are definitely \"not good\" and have ruined peoples lives, probably killed some people as well. It makes me question his motives and data, as it could be tainted. However, his revelations seem quite pertinent. Can you expand on this character and the company he keeps?",
        "Answer": "This is why I’m hesitant about giving too much props to mainstream contactees, especially those in military because while some may start good, they can end up corrupted, especially by the sheer amount of influences coming at them from all/multiple directions. Even Jake Barber is under a lot of pressure and while he has contributed much good, it’s possible even he can crack. It’s very possible the one you mentioned can be tainted – although I cannot claim to know how or when. All I can recommend is using your own intuition – which, even based on this question, you’ve been doing quite soundly.",

        "Question": "Thank you for your reply. I have another question. Perhaps too detailed and unimportant, but I keep thinking about it. How do you translate the information into text? Do you write on the fly during the contact (e.g., with Damien) or do you recall it later and rewrite it?",
        "Answer": "Actually this is extremely important question that I knew, sooner or later, was coming. I’m glad you asked it. The answer = both. Most of the times with the transcriptions where you see their names mentioned, it’s “on the fly” or “in the moment” whereas certain questions asked by people can “trigger” subconsciously stored telepathic data. Sometimes, they can store “prerecorded” telepathic data before the conversations. Spacetime dynamics throws a wrench into this against causal intuitive thinking. For example, our friends from above might be contacting me in a different spacetime dimension altogether – so I pick up on this telepathic information relative to my time/space, but it may be different for theirs. Telepathy is such a superior form of contact that allows transversing of information in all directions of past, present and future. Damien and the others are not kidding. Sometimes the reach is so far ahead that even for me, typing as fast as I can and as accurately in detailed, concise language and expressions – it makes what I do here in the transcriptions, as opposed to what is happening realtime – quite eye-opening as to how much data is being transmitted to and fro at such a stupendous rate of speed. Telepathy is very potent in terms of the exchange of information. If a picture is worth a thousand words, telepathic exchanges even as much as 1 to 5 seconds is worth about 100,000 words. It’s so much data that you have to be careful how you’re transcribing it to prevent burnout.",

        "Question": "The speed of data transmission in telepathy is a fascinating topic. Let me ask two more things in this connection: 1. can you describe how it happens that you map information into words? In what form do they come to you? Are they images or does your intuitive mind just know without thinking what words to use more or less?",
        "Answer": "Intuition knows without words/pictures, then “translates” them using words, pictures, phrases, feels, aspirations, ideas, concepts, philosophies, beliefs, ideologies etc. They come in electromagnetic “waves” that “hook” into you/your being and pull strongly. It’s sending/receiving signals at an elevated rate.",

        "Question": "2. do you sometimes wonder about the certainty of this information? I.e. don't you sometimes think to yourself whether these are simply your own thoughts?",
        "Answer": "When I was a lesser telepath and underdeveloped, yes, I had uncertainties, but telepathy is quite easy the more you hone into it and rigorously train it – especially if you are certain/confident in yourself and your identity. The rule goes – the more uncertain, fearful, paranoid, skeptical, unhinged, mentally and emotionally unstable a person is = the more confusion, mistranslations, and inadequacies. My own voice is very easy to distinguish as opposed to very obvious external voices/influences/thoughts/ideas/projections/feelings/emotions/and other electromagnetic stimuli being pushed my way. Void meditation in the sense of connecting to one’s true self – which is not your thoughts, nor your name, heritage, culture, physical identity or status, education, gender, ethnicity etc. – all of which can be compromised – is “thoughtless” and moves by SPIRIT-WILL-POWER. This is the true YOU, and not your thoughts – which are, simply put – “input” to program. Inputs can be registered from both internal and external sources, which is why the idea that a person is their thoughts is very misleading and dangerous. The true “I” = the force behind thoughts. That is how one can prevent themselves from being misled and confused. Keep this in mind that it doesn’t only apply to ET/NHI contact, but even regular people that can push thoughts/ideas/beliefs/and influences into your mind and make you believe they are your own.",

        "Answer": "It’s predetermined before you even incarnate into a physical vessel on this side – granted, you always have free will, so you can choose not to continue if you wish. You already know what it is – it’s in your subconsciousness and can be accessed through listening to your intuition and true feelings of what/where/how to proceed. That’s why the whole deal with Meditation helps so much. It gives us clarity to listen to the true us within, without all the clutter and noise; the hustle and bustle of the “regular” world. The whole development of activation programs is correlated with self-trust, which leads to self-empowerment. While I can give you some pointers and details, this part of your process requires you to finally come to terms with who/what you are and trust yourself. I can already tell you that your creativity is enormously important.",

        "Question": "2) I was activated in November. Prior to this, I never thought about UFOs or “aliens,” and I definitely would never have taken anyone seriously that described themself as a contactee. I was not a purely materialistic person in any sense, but I had a solid firewall up against anything to do with this subject. Now I am completely changed. It feels like my activation is happening fast, maybe even rushed? Am I being prepped for direct contact or communication? Are all of us ground agents going to experience some sort of contact?",
        "Answer": "Contact is what our friends from above wish for all of us – even if you only get to see some orbs – it leads to stimulation of further activation processes. For some, it can be direct telepathic commune. Others, it can be that they must create this or that, or speak to this person or another – or even just show a smile to a person on the street which creates a butterfly effect – creating further events/activation processes for others and eventually, the masses. Activation processes are meticulously crafted and programmed from the other side. It’s similar to writing a sophisticated code filled with 0/1s (NOT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE!) – that, based upon circumstances in life, both good and bad, and everything in between – triggers certain sensations, feelings, ideas, and thoughts that push us to go here and there. Sometimes, some of us are born with a “firewall” against aliens/UFOs/spiritual topics on purpose because the activation codes/processes utilizes multiple angles/ways/frequencies, including skepticism (at first) – as a means for unstoppable activation when the time comes, and the synchronicities align. By that point, the activated can’t really deny and comes to terms with who/what they are. However, as Morpheus said to Neo, there’s a difference between knowing the path and walking it. free will always matters. Choice is above causality. Remember this.",

There are more programs and practices that will become available as time goes on – especially psionic defenses. “Mantis” recently told me that despite the good we are experiencing in our community and contactees/ground agents are becoming awakened, we must not be naïve. There are terrestrial forces with technology that can hone into “awakening/awakened ones” and their frequencies and send negative telepathy/psychic emissions their way to dissuade them, confuse them, and discourage them on their path. A couple posters here such as mcgarryb4, cosmico, and Incarna have either commented or posted tips on how to protect yourself. There will be much more to come, including from myself. Although the bible is fake, this part bears truth – “We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but the powers and principalities in high places.” It is indeed mostly a psionic warfare.",

        "Answer": "Despite new age tomfoolery and excessive dogma about consciousness, consciousness is, simply put – awareness. In the case of sentience, it’s “awareness that can relate to itself” – but awareness cannot exist without MIND-activity. Love is the primordial force that becomes ALL – be it light, energy, vibration, position, time, and space. Think of love as the underlying “force” that enables all others to exist. It is beyond mere consciousness. It is ETERNAL BEING.",

        "Question": "Can you offer any specific details concerning what we might expect during the coming months? I understand that in general terms, things are going to be heating up (we can see it happening all around us) and that the exact dates will depend on a multitude of factors. But there have also been predictions of “something big” happening this summer. I’ve also seen predictions of a “light” / ascension event, massive NHI / ET ships appearing on US coastlines, etc. I know that whatever happens is for our own evolution and growth, and I welcome it, but I can’t help but be curious.",
        "Answer": "ET ships, especially with the not-drones incident, was one of the few times of mass sightings on such a global level (that’s still ongoing, by the way – just not being reported!). This year has had a MASSIVE UNSTOPPABLE SHIFT. Yes, some channelers may go overboard with the light and love to the extreme – but in truth, they are right. The “main battle” between good and evil has already been won. I cannot disclose too many details of this just yet because it’s too early. I will eventually, but what you should know is that me (and others) interconnected in this mission have been waging “psionic warfare” that, as of 2025, has been largely won for the good of mankind. A lot of positive shifts are happening. However, to make an omelet, I suppose you have to crack some eggs. A lot of the bad forces, especially the elite rulership, won’t like what has happened and what is coming. They’ll try double-time to push war, chaos, division, negativity, pessimism and the like in your face – especially with the news and alternative media. This is all part of their plan to keep humanity locked in a bubble of negativity. Look beyond it. The good is winning. More and more people are waking up every day. 2025 is the first year in centuries that I can tell you the earth, despite some necessary upcoming turmoil, will be fine and will make it.",

You discussed the idea of soulmates and have intimated that love is a motivating factor in your own journey. My soulmate died a few years ago, and there’s a huge part of me that feels like she should be by my side during this journey. And I know that we will be together again, possibly in future incarnations, but my heart is still broken. What is possible in terms of reunion, both physically and spiritually?",
        "Answer": "This is very possible – but it also must be “her” choice from “the other side.” Listen to your intuition and your true feelings. If “she” (because she is beyond gender in the other side) accepts – then a reincarnation is possible – and/or a part or an imbuement of her soul field can be “inserted” into another human who is receptive to the interconnection – and thus, your soulmate can be technically ‘reborn’ in the here and now – via another human. The scene from Blade Runner 2049 with Joi interfacing with Mariette to create intimacy with K (Ryan Gosling) is a primitive example of this.",

        "Question": "On occasion I take magic mushrooms, not recreationally but to advance understanding of reality and myself. My most recent experience had four distinct phases. In the first I there were 3 praying mantis looking beings I took them as the “hosts” of the event. I could tell I was me and they were introducing what was to come next. But I only remember a feeling not any specific messages. Next I was surrounded by Native American looking beings and I had the distinct feeling I was one of them, they were trying to pull me out of something, like I was struggling to free myself and they were helping. The third part I was in a similar situation but I was confronted by three bird people, and I was also one of them. And the final part I was on a path to meet the creator, it was a winding path that when I got to the end turned in on itself and where I was to meet the creator I found myself and I felt a profound loneliness. That all ended as I was coming down a wave of information hit me that essentially said Elon Musk ended a timeline or ended the country of something about home and the end of a significant road for humanity. This was a few weeks ago just before he started running wild on the government. There were other parts of that last bundle of messages that are probably better as a separate question. Can you or your contacts help unpack this? I forgot to mention the intention I set for that trip was to make contact and understand what I am. What I am has been a life long question I’ve been struggling with",
        "Answer": "You experienced their messages channeled through your visions – which, of course, had to use your own “imaginative reaches” to “contemplate” the data outside of your consciousness. This was a form of contact. Elon Musk is very evil and is not an ally of extraterrestrials because he wishes to control the world. Your messages were symbolic.",

DMT, like other psychedelics and consciousness-alterations to potential higher states, is acceptable and quite good only if the person is mentally, emotionally, and physically healthy and stable. It can unlock many secrets and since some people can be comfortable enough in these states, be a bridge for contact.

It kind of feels like they're outside of our cage telling us to keep fighting to get out when they have the keys. What am I missing?",
        "Answer": "There will be a more expanded response to this in the upcoming posts after I have correlated with “Mantis” for further information. Long story short, what we consider to be “humanity” solely in the sense of the physicality, is not entirely us, and much of the reasoning for many of us being here – was ironically, our own choices from “the other side” – either to help better the world or to experience what it’s like in this particular simulation. As Mantis told me – “seeding life is a good, yet complicated deed” – so while life was seeded here initially, for good, it was mismanaged by several parties. Some parties are also learning, considering that this is their first real “dev project” since they themselves also came from a former simulation and were woken up to start simulating worlds themselves. They have the keys only to a certain extent. It’s sort of like having a child. You can guide them and give them the tools necessary for their successes in life, but they must ultimately make their own decisions. There will be an extensive reply on this in the upcoming days with one of the new posts, look out for it.",

        "Question": "Thank you for answering. Can you elaborate on the disagreement’s from above?",
        "Answer": "Yes, I personally disagreed with the way how some of our ET friends from above handled things – mostly our “human ET friends” from above. I understand what they were trying to do/achieve but it was MY OPINION that what they did also created damage in various ways. Most ETs will allow people to think of them the way they wish – and this is especially the case with those prone to mysticism and teachings. Our human allies from above in conjunction with other NHI believed that they could reach those who were “willing to accept them” as they are. Unfortunately, some of these people were racists, white supremacists, and those who believed in the Nazi-Aryan ideology of racial supremacy – especially the typical blonde, blue eyed, tall and perfect-jawed “human” – which some of our allies from above – do have some resemblance to. This, in my opinion, allowed much evil to be created which led to racism of other ET races and division among contactees. However, as they previously said – they use anyone and everyone and they cannot be held fully responsible for how people perceive/what they make of their contact/channelings. They more care about the overall effect down the line, which even hoaxers, grifters, and gurus have added to positively. At the same time, these hoaxers, fraudsters, cultists, mystics, “prophets” and teachers and their stupid teachings dismantle themselves eventually while providing greater truth to the masses. I guess it works when you look at the bigger picture, but it’s just one of those things I am not a fan of with their approach. I understand it, I just don’t have to agree with it.",

When creating an account here, I just simply chose my first name for a username, partly due to the understanding that we are protected here and felt I wanted to be true to myself (also acknowledging now that my given name is not the \"realme\") and not act out of fear. I now wonder if I have unnecessarily opened myself up to those who may wish to do me harm. I am feeling the need to change my name here and have been exploring some options.

        "Answer": "Your intuition is correct. We have to stop believing that because we expose ourselves, we automatically are screwed. This is not true. You’ve also seen from my posts lately that our friends from above give us warnings not to stir fear or anxiety, but for us to be STRONG in our self-confidence and truth. If you KNOW nothing can harm you, then it won’t. In terms of my case, I have my identity hidden for the while to assure certain things are set up with our mission that it can never be compromised.

I need more help on how to get weird negative thoughts out of my head for good. I worry about my kids all the time, maybe more than is normal.",
        "Answer": "Worry brings more reason to create worry. Fear begets fear. Meditation should be a “sacred space” where you allow yourself to be guilt-free and worry-free. Try to calm yourself and do things that bring you peace. If it’s watching the water flow downstream the river, do it. If it’s listening to some tunes that you love, then do it – as opposed to “listening to frequencies.” You have to quell the anxiety in yourself by using another approach. Know that your thoughts do not have any power unless you give them. You do not have to give into any thought unless you choose. The power is in your hands. Skip the gateway tapes and “void meditation” if it’s too much, too quick. Void Meditation often “brings up” what we’ve stored/compartmentalized, so it can be rather confrontational to deal with repressed emotions and feelings. Yet, the only way to do so is to go forward through them – at your own pace. Be well and have much peace.",

        "Question": "1. Do you think the average person should learn to astral project, and if so, what should they do or where should they go once out of the physical body?",
        "Answer": "No, I do not think the “average person” should learn to astral project, nor engage in telepathy or any ESP of any kind. Why? Because the average person is too groomed/conditioned to be fearful, obsessed with phantasmagoria, end of the world prophecies and doomsday news, among a host of unresolved traumas, mental, and emotional issues that would make engaging with ESP very dangerous. My opinion is the average person should first focus on self-love and come to terms with what is truth and reality before proceeding to ESP.",

        "Answer": "Good question. There will be a post coming up in a few days to address it further – but let’s just say we are spliced with a couple genetics from a few races, including greys, that helped seed us here. Mantis’ “race” also helped organize this, among others. Human avatars on earth were not originally built to be defective. They became this way because of the influence and decisions the collectives made – whether intentional or not. Our genetic pool on earth has “lessened” since the original ancestors of earthling-types were planted here due to how civilization has ran/its interests – which was focused on the “lower realm” and thus, adapted vessels for that purpose/drive/intention.",

        "Question": "3. Can you tell us any more accounts of NHI/greys and other beings that have had run ins with powerful humans or got “caught”? You talked about the one who sacrificed himself and crashed a ufo rather than offer up information. Has there been a time where others were at the mercy of human beings or are nhi generally so advanced at implanting thoughts that they largely get away whenever they wish?",
        "Answer": "There are no terrestrial or ET type of humans that are as powerful as the full grey collective. The “powerful humans” you refer to are just “the ones in power.” For greys, they’ve willingly allowed their vessels/bodies to be captured and even experimented on because they knew it wouldn’t provide much information other than soft disclosure of truth due to how primitive/focused on the “lower realm” earth mankind is. Since they can reconstitute, they can also abandon the avatar and leave it to whatever their captors wish to do with it. Yes, some have allowed themselves to be captured, only to “walk right out the front door” while in their captors’ minds, they believe they have captured/dissected the being – although this is a mental projection/telepathy by the said advanced captured beings. Other types of advanced ETs have allowed themselves to be captured and serve in a “containment” where they do not come to harm. There have been some ET on ET “violence”, but these are usually rare and these types of torture are so concealed that if the full federations were to know of the truths behind them, there would be a gigantic intergalactic war. It’s unlikely this is going to happen, however.",

        "Question": "4. If manifestation is real, why don’t the NHI manifest their goals to fruition? Or is “the point” of it for US as humans to collectively learn how to manifest for and with love? If so does that mean the nhi are actively guiding and helping us to manifest and shape our future? As in, transcendence requires us to be more able manifestos/creators..?",
        "Answer": "I have to be very careful with what I am allowed to disclose regarding this question. Let’s just say, our NHI friends from above have “already manifested a positive outcome” for earth (along with ground agents here on this planet) who have “already won the major battle.” However, this was done in a (space beyond this time) and as such, the “effects” are “falling into place” and it would seem “slower/gradual” from our perspective in this “lower spacetime.” Let’s just say the main battle’s already won and we’re just watching things fall into place, bit by bit. You spoke of manifestation, well, it’s the same there too – right? Great things rarely manifest immediately. It takes time to build – yet the first victory is in one’s mind before it manifests itself tangibly as “physicality.”",

        ],
        "Question": "It seems to me that the US Government is playing a huge role in pushing us towards disclosure, but not in the way that most of us would expect. Disclosure will happen when humanity is ready for it. I interpret that to mean when most of the population understands that we are all individuations of universal consciousness. That we are all one. When we truly understand and embrace nonduality. The most effective way to unite people is against a common enemy, which we have seen in the US for decades. There has always been a boogie man, a common enemy to rally against. But until now, the tactic has been to unite the US against a perceived “other”, the enemy is “them”. What the current administration is doing is different. They are doing everything within their power to establish themselves as the enemy – the enemy of both of the American people and of the rest of the world. If they are successful, the ultimate effect will be to unite all of humanity – or at least a huge chunk of it – against the American government. This collective unity, bolstered by the frequency adjustments (Schumann Resonances, etc) and other “nudges” we are being given will hopefully be enough to push us over the edge and into disclosure, ascension, higher density, evolution, etc. It also seems like this might have been what Hitler / Nazism was about, until the US went nuclear and NHI had to step in before we did irrevocable damage to ourselves and those in other dimensions. This time, NHI are making sure that doesn’t happen. Is this close to what is happening? I understand if you can’t confirm or deny, but I feel like I was just given this message and wanted to get your feedback.",
        "Answer": "Your intuition is spot on and everything you said above is correct. The US government is doing disclosure for their own aims – although I cannot say that everyone is bad. There are some good players in disclosure, just as much as there is bad. It’s a cold war of its own.",

It’s similar to lowered potency of the scent which leads to better eyesight. What messes with one sense can enhance another. It depends on the person/their aims. A person seeking contact with another person across the globe would naturally develop more telepathic/ESP potential because of the need/adaptation. You get the idea.",

It’s why “alien realmes” incarnating in “human form” have to have a large portion of their “realme memories” stored subconsciously because the newly awakening avatar/human would go mad.

I’m just curious what the black triangle crafts are? I witnessed one back around 2008, it hovered not far from me, over top a pine tree on my family farm. No seams, rivets, windows etc.. each point had 6-8’ diameter glowing plasma , nothing in the center that i noticed. No sound either. It was maybe 30’ feet above the tree, huge craft. After a few minutes, it slowly hovered across the field then suddenly disappeared in front of my eyes! I was maybe 100 -150yards away. Any ideas? Why did it hover above the tree? Was it showing itself to me? I’ve had other experiences since then. Thanks for everything you’ve passed on to us! Can’t imagine the load you have to deal with.",

        "Question": "Hi Prudence, thank you for the post this morning. It was a pleasure to read and as usual, continues to help expand and awaken. I've been focusing on rediscovering and learning my true self, particularly it's signature /aura/vibe so that I can easily identify it from \"other\". For context, the other day I felt the now telltale TTT (Telepathic tingle [back of the head] and tinnitus). Focusing on filling myself with peace, I set my intent to parse through the energy and try to distinguish between me and the other. I've become familiar with my signature and was able to discern between the two, and when I did, I felt amusement (as you've described during your interviews with the collective) and heard \"clever girl\". I then set to shielding and blocking, with the intent being more of a test or challenge rather than a threat. My question is, would any of the beings making contact ever refer to us according to our vessel gender? How I heard, \"clever girl\" when identifying the other. Or, did they call me an unfamiliar or unknown pronoun and my mind substituted what it did know, \"girl\".",
        "Answer": "Yes, they do. You had contact! They can only use what’s in your mind/consciousness, so the clearer, healthier, and more stable you are – and also – being grounded in yourself/knowing who/what YOU are – the better you can understand/facilitate contact without confusion.\nThis is less of a question and more of a curiosity. I wonder if it was anyone you are familiar with and if so, they'd be able to share the method of shielding and expulsion I tried. I made a post on reddit a while ago that I deleted out of fear, but it detailed some of the shielding and expulsion I'd been doing prior to discovering your site. I acted out of fear and ignorance and honestly, with the intent to hurt out of protecting my home in some cases. My final notes, that I plan to share in the forum, are visions I've received. One today, I pulling myself out of the primordial swamp. With the head and shoulders of a beautiful woman, my torso and legs were those of a great lizard. Stout, but string as it climbed through the muck. The second, I was the rock at Cueva de las Manos, swollen with love and pride as thousands of hands pressed into me. I heard their fires crack while the people laughed, they were excited to leave their prints and mark on the world and I, the world, was so proud to have them. The third, is of the true me. I am a sentient aurora, my colors warm and shifting in intensity. I can spread out into everything, or spiral upwards and out into the sky like a glowing fountain. Another dances me with me, I've been calling them to twist with me into one brilliant display of light and eternity. A voice told me that I would return home, I'll know when the time is right. I feel simultaneously at peace and irritable to have been given a taste when I can't yet fully submerge myself.\nA: Thank you for sharing those experiences with me. What I can tell you is that it’s all about the WILLPOWER. You can use affirmations, “prayers”, chants, imaginations, sigils, crystals, or whatever your fancy – so long as you put the power/force/will into it. For example, you can project a shield or barrier around you in your imagination – and if you believe/are completely convicted it works – then it works. The simplicity of psionics is perhaps its greatest sophistication and security against the anxious, restless mind.",

        "Question": "Hello I just read a few things that I find intriguing in the latest posts and wanted to ask you about them. If you can’t answer the question publicly I understand, so I leave it up to you to decide whether to post this query. The first relates to the technology platform you are using to host this website and a clue about an individual and country who is somehow involved which led me to think “Israel”. Then just now I read about the 3-3-3 group fro Orion who originally contacted Moishe (Moses) and you said, yes that’s the same group and I’m also connected to Moses. Then I thought of Melchizedek and what the Urantia book says about him being the planetary prince and his prior incarnation on earth. I don’t draw any conclusions from this data but wanted to share the connections I made just now, and ask whether you have any further insight you could share. Thank you 😊",
        "Answer": "Today’s post should help you with answering this further: A Conversation with \"Damien\" Part III\nTo add a further bit of data, I am familiar with the Law of One and the being known as Yahweh who appeared to Moishe and sought to instruct him. I believe he was of Orion origin if my memory is correct. I find this very fascinating, but not more fascinating that somehow, through the intelligent guidance of beings higher than me, I can say this and it makes complete sense to me, even though I have a strong foundation in Evangelical Christianity, and all these ideas completely shatter that belief system. Far from experiencing ontological shock I feel relief through letting go of false reality constructs. It’s easier for me at this point in my journey to accept that Yahweh was an ET that appeared to Moses and influenced him as part of an ongoing ET Psyop or manipulation of the simulation, than to believe what I used to believe relative to God, spirituality and reality in general. The confusion is systematic and widespread, but I wholeheartedly agree that it’s humans themselves who are to blame for the low levels of consciousness on this planet, even though some of those efforts to intervene and offer revelation to humans did not have the intended result. I got some information wrong, the entity known as Yahweh was a confederation entity seeking to promulgate the law of One in service to others, and the Orion group was able to use these teachings to establish the idea of an elite that could then enslave and conquer the in-elite. Though perhaps distinctions between groups is unnecessary I felt I should correct my earlier error.\nA: Thank you for sharing that. It’s understandable, but even in that book, there are some errors, I’m afraid. The Orion group has tried to assist mankind in many ways, but they have often been misunderstood and demonized. Moses was one of their contactees.",

You can push this force just by WILL alone. It’s possible potency can be sacrificed for balance, yes, as I myself do this just to “blend in” at times. It’s not about full, raw, unbridled potency (like Broly from DBS), rather it’s wisdom (Like Gogeta from DBS), technique, and skill of one’s potency that wins the long haul.",

        "Question": "If you may, I'd love to have you ponder with one of your contacts on this 'vision' I've had persistently building. It's hard to describe without using the christian symbology I've seen it in, though I submit it is only a form of language, not a dogmatic backing. God (the body of existence), Lucifer (Light of consciousness), Lucifer doing the bidding of God, whom is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. Lucifer associated with Satan (the accuser) One whom questions god (consciousness), the ability to experience and free will. If this 'spirit/angel/consciousness' of god thought it's gifts were only worthy of god, and so god (the body) fractured lucifer/satan/light/consciousnes to be within all bodies, as it seeks back to source, learning why it was neccessary, and thus being the warden and the inmate of it's rehabilitation in terms of the 'hell' aspect. I understand dualistic views aren't correct,. and I'm trying to word this without leaning into that, so I apologize if dualistic language is used in descriptions. This though, lends to that the universe would not waste space, it would have things compacted layered over one another, so any aspect of heaven and hell being outside of this existence would be incorrect, especially if consciousness withdraws from the earthly vessel to plant its roots elsewhere after death, though even this is through a view of time from our perspective. Plus for a being so close to source, theres no way to imagine it's way of thought, perhaps it looked up beyond itself too longing to be back one, but was on the outward breath to be scattered, on its way back round to the inhale to one again. I'm feeling drained so I'll end this, but one last thing I feel the need to mention is I have been drawn to various 'keys' and 'locks', especially in music. the hermetic texts, the band Tool's discography, Kendrick Lamar, Gojira, there are lots in music that seem to lead to 'portals'.",
        "Answer": "It’s coming to you within your consciousness landscape, so you already have a very solid idea. Trust your intuition. I’ll say that “Tool” = a contactee “band” – especially Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned songs.",

        "Question": "Hi Prudence and thank you for the prompt honest responses. As a channel for \"The Angels,\" I too have been experiencing impulses to teach and spread wisdom and love. But sometimes I can recognize situations where I really shouldn't impart someone (particularly those who I can determine to be not ready for the lessons they would like me to impart upon them) yet they continue to push these impulses upon me no matter how inappropriate the situation. It's quite frustrating because I don't think they understand certain human dynamics nor the concept of when it's appropriate to act on said impulses. Have you experienced impulses such as these and if so, how do you learn to reject them (kindly of course)?",
        "Answer": "Yes, I have. Sometimes our friends from above don’t fully understand how difficult it can be dealing with people, and it can be scary as ground agents putting ourselves at risk like these situations you described. What I’d suggest is to do it very subtly or do it in a way – almost like speaking in “code” or being cryptic, vague, etc., that can “trigger” potential thoughts of truth. Remember, what matters is not so much the direct words of the message, but the MEANING which can be translated through FEELING. Sometimes, if it’s really out of my scope to impart a message, then I’d humbly let my contacts know “guys, this isn’t working” – to which, despite any disappointment or personal feelings they may have, they’ll respect it/alter course. Just be brave, upfront, and real with our friends from above. Don’t fear them, even if you have to kindly say “no.” They’ll understand.",

        "Question": "Much love, Prudence; I have a personal question if that's alright (no rush or anything I understand you're very busy at times) but, what's the likelihood I have a connection to a collective? I'm unsure of who I'm connected to, but I've always felt a deep alienation in my life. At times it's felt like I was being guided in terrible situations by someone close to me. I would often feel a sense of warmth around me, like a hug. Especially when I would breakdown or cry.. I've often heard voices that I've identified as not my own but I confuse myself on if it's my imagination, in which I guess it is because my telepathy is undeveloped?",
        "Answer": "Correct. Telepathy can only be honed/developed to its full and ongoing potency by good health, balance, and wellbeing. Trust in oneself. No negativity, pessimism, doubt, fear, uncertainty, nihilism disguised as “logic”, nor extreme skepticism to hold you back. This takes time, especially if one has had traumatic experiences and unresolved/unhealed emotional wounds.\nAt last, whenever I would stargaze I would feel incredibly homesick. It would feel like the stars would call to me. I'm wondering from your perspective; In my heart I believe I'm at least partially directly related to perhaps a Sirian/Lyran collective. I'm particularly attracted to cats and feline features and attributes and ways of living. Sorry for the long message, adonai vasu borragus 🫶🏿\nA: That’s because you are, and they are real.

        "Question": "Hi just to reply back real quick. So all of your advice is good and all and I have actually been having conversations with my friends from above about their impulses not really equating to the expression of my own free will especially since I'm new to all this. Unfortunately, in my psionic developmental infancy and naivety, have revealed information in full force out in public many times without realizing the risk that it brings to me and everyone I know. I've unfortunately fallen victim to these impulses u-u. With this being the case, I've noticed all sorts of odd phenomenon occurring around me that I assume comes with being a target (ie followed by cars, people, and all the like. I think I heard them try to snipe me lol. Also I have reason to believe that bad faith actors and NHI have been triggering some bad emotions in myself, my friends and my fam unfortunately). I'm sorry to put this responsibility on you and I appreciate all the work so far but do you have any tips for how to thwart off what they have been trying to do with me? So far, I have done a crapton of positive manifestation while also relying on my own psionic abilities and the power of my friends above and so far, it's been working great for me. I don't fear them at all and I'm filled with love and gratefulness at all times tho so I do assume that that's contributing a lot to the protection and wellbeing of people around me. Just wondering if you have more tips for me. Ty",
        "Answer": "There’s no going around it, my friend. Meditation itself is to bring clarity and that will bring up unresolved issues, traumas, negativity etc., for you to confront them and rectify – so sometimes, certain negative impressions, including dreams – can actually work to create an overall positive effect – which also goes to show the illusion of positive-negative when in reality, ALL is CHOICE – and one’s choice should be, ideally – GOOD. Yes, I understand how that can happen with the cars, people, “glitches” etc., because when they usually input us to do something, they have follow-up “events” set. When we refuse/do something different, it can create a minor butterfly effect. Try not to worry so much about it. Continue focusing on the good; the love, and what is true – and all these other “negative” effects, even if you don’t follow-through with an “input from above” – will be overridden, regardless of “glitches.”",

        "Question": "Hello Prudence, I have felt...shy to actually communicate, and often it feels like I should wait for more communication. I wanted to take a little time to speak on something. I am what I consider to be a \"gender fluid\" person. I enjoy the conceptions of male, female, and, blending these two into a sort of unity in my imagination. I've lived as a \"trans masculine\" female (which, to be honest, when you gendered me as \"him\" I smiled and was amused, does not bother me, use any pronouns you wish, but it is intriguing for me to see which becomes the \"default\" when I haven't explicitly said) While I do not regret my time on testosterone at all, and I had a breast reduction surgery I'm quite happy with overall, over time, the transition aspect was not really for me. In particular, recall what I said about a difficult awakening? Yeah, that was during an INCREDIBLY abusive relationship in which a man wanted to FORCE my transition to masculine, upon hearing even a little bit about my feelings of exploring masculinity. So...that is to say, I'm pretty \"in the middle\" on this subject, and having a lot of thoughts today. It feels like the extreme push to go back to gender tradition is entirely wrong, but so is the other extreme, letting children do medical things to their bodies which can be permanent and cause sterilization, among other things. Anyway, rambling aside, my intuition I feel is this. It is not UNUSUAL for people such as myself, to be exploring this. Throughout human history, even, there are those minorities who explore these feelings. I am getting the sense, in fact, that at times, some \"gender feelings\" that are beyond male and female may have to do with some of this \"spirit\" pipeline stuff that has been discussed recently. These beings did say, in the latest, that these transgender feelings often have to do with \"past incarnations\" which I feel strongly. Am I onto something there?",
        "Answer": "I understand these topics can be difficult to confront for all of us, especially when we are taught extremes on all sides - either hard (red) or hard (blue) when, once more, these are just living aspects of duality positive-negative-heaven-and-hell-god-and-satan thinking that continues to divide us. I already sensed from the get-go you have a connection to the (reptilian) species that I'll soon be in contact with. You are most certainly onto something here and you should trust your intuition. The (reptilians) are, according to D, \"mystics\" of their own right. Perhaps this is why they've ran into such strong opposition with human mystical egos. Be well and have a great weekend.

        "Answer": "Females usually are the “birthers” as 0 whereas “males” represent 1 which are the “carriers.” This is different from positive-negative duality/bipolarity, which speaks about a ½ or ¾ as opposed to 0/1, which is harmonious to each other. Additional sexes/genders etc., can only be formed from the initial unity/oneness principle of 0/1 – which is why male and female are important as aspects of one in 0 = infinity and 1 as one = individual unit. 0/1 allows creation of all numbers that follow suit.",

It is hard to separate love from a being when you cannot be sure if the intent is conscious. How can I/we/someone put themselves first when it could 'hurt' the collective? A test of achieving activation?",
        "Answer": "This is a very good question. Love, contrary to misinterpretations, is not a weakness in the sense that it allows a self-abuse. Love is an EXISTENCE-ENABLING-FORCE which means that it is power itself. This power can be used to draw lines of respect and healthy boundaries between parties – be it ET or terrestrial alike. So, in terms of self-interest and self-love, you have to love yourself first before you can truly love others in its entirety. This is different from the absolute extremes of selfishness and hyper-independent teachings and philosophies that teach it’s ALL about the self. This self-love is a universality that, through your individual ONE of the ALL – is able to first express itself with you; thus heal/nurture/guide/empower you, and like a waterfall, the water can be “sent down the line” to others. Healthy boundaries, standing up for yourself, knowing when to say no etc., are all a part of REAL LOVE. REAL LOVE is healthy and not Stockholm syndrome.",

        "Question": "Reading your posts gives me a glimpse into how telepathy works. Data is transmitted instantly, but for people to understand it, it must be “translated” into a comprehensible form. Before translation, is this chunk of raw data an image? A sound? Or is it something indescribable in such terms? I’m really curious about the nature of this “pure” data. Could you elaborate on it?",
        "Answer": "No, images and sounds = still part of the consciousness-amalgamation-matrix. The actual “telepathic data” = quantum signals and electromagnetic frequencies. In its raw ‘form’ it is energy from “being to being” which is why Mantis describes it as “BEING-FEELING.”",

        "Question": "My dog may not be more intelligent than I am, but he seems to have much greater empathy. I firmly believe that singularity exists within them as well. 2-1 | Is intelligence separate from spiritual development? Can animals achieve spiritual enlightenment and cease reincarnation? Or is a human level of intelligence necessary for Apotheosis, making it impossible for animals?",
        "Answer": "Of course dogs/animals/insects/plants/gasses/water/rocks/earths/planets/suns/stars = all have singularities of their own that we can call a (spirit). Dogs have more “open” empathy than humans because humans are trained from their cultures, backgrounds, heritages, social status and expectancies, religions, environments, education and so on that they shouldn’t be so empathetic – especially in “material-focused” societies. So, it’s not to say that humans have less, it’s to say here on earth, it is conditioned to be lower. Intelligence is more than just intellectual, logical, scientific, or mathematical intelligence. It is also intuitive, psychic, empathetic, artistic, creative, abstract, philosophical, emotional intelligence, willpower, self-intelligence from awareness aka consciousness-intelligence, among others. True intelligence is compromised of ALL intelligence forms, and not just one – which is why when so-called earthly “science” demands only one or two intelligence types and neglects the others – is hardly “intelligent” in true “intelligence” form. It also gives false-positive data. Think about this: the “historically smartest man” – Einstein – was ironically, VERY INTUITIVE and emotional as opposed to many of his peers who were stiff and robotic. So, true intelligence is similar to having a “character sheet” in an RPG. For example, in classics like WoW or DnD, you have “stats” such as STR, INT, DEX, WIS, END etc., and it’s a similar idea for “true intelligence” with the different forms of “stats” or “intelligence.” The higher/more developed the “spirit” = more “stat points” to work with. This is why some lower spirit forms can have “logic” or “mathematics” maxed out and be severely lacking in other areas such as empathy, consciousness, and creative intelligence forms. Advanced spirit forms can have multiple aspects of different types of intelligences at high calibers – it simply depends on the need of the realme incarnating into its avatar and its mission/purpose/reason for existing. Females, for example, often do not always take “male”-focused intelligence forms and can be neglected for their intelligent types such as the emotional, psychic, and creative, among others. Advanced spirits can easily hide in females, and they won’t be recognized and easily neglected for not having “male-focused” intelligence forms. Contrary to the hyper physical-realm focus, intelligence is not correlated with genes, it is directly related to the “spirit” – so yes, it is correlated with apotheosis, yet one must not become confused that to be intelligent means to be a robot or ultralogical-being; which, while bearing some intelligence, is not an indicator of TOTAL-INTELLIGENCE which is the real indicator of spiritual power. Furthermore, our realmes developed from “animal realmes” and lower forms than that, millions and millions of years ago. There’s a link. Lower life can spiritually develop into higher life and incarnate into higher forms. The “human spirit” or “realme” was not originally “human” to begin with and just as we can ascend into “Ascended Prime”-BEING, the same applies reverse before “human spirits” even came into be – which was borrowed from the ancestral “spiritual lineages” that go back to animals, lower life, instinctual life, and non-life as a whole. There’s a link – just like there’s a link between how a planet can become a gas giant, which can become a brown dwarf, which can become a sun, and in reverse order.",

        "Answer": "You are correct they’d incarnate into a “higher plant form” until they no longer need to reincarnate into a lower instinctual form. The previous answer from the first question should already give you a very solid idea. Intellect is not true/full intelligence and is only one factor of the TOTAL-INTELLIGENCE that involves a myriad of forms. True intelligence/true advancement/more evolved beings aren’t so absolute/imbalanced in one side – they tend to have multiple forms of intelligence types as discussed above.",

        "Question": "Beings who have undergone long periods of spiritual training seem capable of logical thinking even without physical support (i.e., without the aid of a brain). This is vastly different from ordinary humans on Earth, who can experience drastic personality changes, memory loss, speech impairment, or even revert to a childlike mental state if certain parts of their brain deteriorate. 3-1| Can the soul be affected by issues with the brain's physical structure? I’ve always thought of reality as merely an output of the soul field, but could physical changes in the brain actually influence the soul field in return? Processed foods are said to be harmful to the soul—so would it be correct to say that the state of the body in the physical world also affects the soul field?",
        "Answer": "Yes, to a certain extent, but not necessarily harmful to the soul field and spirit because these areas cannot be harmed. It only adjusts what can be transmitted between dimensions. The soul/spirit “adapts” to the physicality. It’s a “dance between dimensions” and if one “partner” isn’t feeling it, the other “adapts” to their needs. In this case, if the brain is damaged, if the body is poisoned, if the emotions are sullied and the mentality is polluted, then the soul/spirit makes the necessary adjustments so that the physical avatar isn’t overwhelmed and adapts accordingly for continued feedback-loops relative to its allowance/capabilities.",

I have these beings all around me, even in my home. I big 3 foot snake one that literally sucks the energy right out of me. Apparently it’s called “looshing”? Victoria Whitney told me that. I hope she is not a fraud as well. Anyways sometimes it feels extremely manufactured, like it might be humans using nano technology? I seen a snake in the air, pretty sure it merged with an orb. Anyways I just want to know if these are real or are they part of an invasion scheme some military group might be planning? I have some video if you need it. They also have been psychically attacking me. All I know how to do is send them love, lots of love. If you have any other suggestions I need all that I can get!

        "Answer": "Thank you for your honesty as well and wishing you wellness and protection during this time. That definitely sounds a little more complicated. Sending them love is one thing, but you also have to create psionic blocks/barriers and create a healthy boundary between all forces – whether ET or terrestrial. I’ll have to ask my contacts for more information with your particular case. For now, practice healthy boundaries between these forces and let love win. Do not fear anyone or anything.",

But two months ago I had my first contact in my head. I had been practicing manifestation with a few things with varying success (Got a significant raise at my job, healed a wound overnight and a few others). Then while speaking my montra with my inner voice in another attempt to manifest something. Then I heard an answer. I'm not sure from where but he told me to think about my montra in a slightly different way. I started conversing with him not really knowing who or where he was.

I can also confirm that you are quite lucky to have the inner monologue silent as such a normality as some of our neurodivergent brothers and sisters do not have it so easy. You can continue to broaden the connection to your (ET friend from above) by allowing yourself to be open to higher truths, even if it shatters your bubbles. Be willing to connect. Focus your intention on this. Mediate as well. You clearly have developed a great self-sovereignty; so additionally, I’ll just say to continue being you simply to the best of your ability.

I understand what you are talking about fully now, during the trip I felt if I wanted to communicate to a UFO I would be able to easily. I was unable to though as I have emotional baggage from my poor behaviour to others earlier on in my life. I believe that to fully come into my own person and 'level up' as these ET want me to do, I need to apologise to the people I've hurt and manage my emotional affairs so they don't play on my mind. Would you say this is accurate? Thank you the individual of myself who call themself prudence for writing down this information so that the individual that calls itself … can read it. One Ness is a beautiful thing and I hope this play turns out alright, as I don't like the way it's going. I have to trust that it is happening for good reason though. I don't think I would do all this with no resolution or meaninglessness. Also I have to ask. Are we heading into the third act? Or are we already in it",
        "Answer": "Hello and thank you for your message. Overall, you’ve come to the right conclusions already – so yes, this is accurate. Also, it’s your prerogative, my friend. If you feel deep down you must do whatever you have to do, then do it and get your clean/clear conscience. The less bogged down you are, the more you can establish clearer contact and good commune with our friends from above. As for the last question – I have to give a 3-point-pincer-loop answer by saying the “fight for earth” has already been “won” sometime in the “future” and we’re now “watching it play out in slow motion/3d-time.”",

        "Question": "Deep thanks for the courage and wisdom you've displayed by bringing this treasure trove of insight to the world! Sorry, hit send too soon😁 You mentioned the challenges one faces in life. My childhood was Capitol D dysfunctional and as an adult I've sometimes thought life's hurdles came along a lot faster and in greater numbers than other people I knew. Your mention of your own issues and challenges got me wondering if this all has to do with the times we currently face. I've not had contact or abductions that I know of, but your website resonates with me on a myriad of levels. Is it too late for a 71 year old grandpa to wake up?",
        "Answer": "Hello sir and thank you for your message and kindness. The answer to your question is simple – it is NEVER too late! You are never too “old” to learn new things. It’s a matter of one’s own willingness to let go of the old and embrace the new. Trust yourself and your capabilities. You have more power than you assume.",

The being did the same pulse but far more significant. I asked who they were? The face was never visible, but they laughed, and I saw a tapestry with many faces, like film frames woven beyond number moving. There was never any ill intent behind the feelings or the laugh. Hermes/Mikael/Thoth only some of the names, yet also all of them. The one known as the 'son' of the trinity before even the birth of Jesus, the being all of the same energy outside the dogma. I've been trying to see further. I am deeply personally interested in your connection and how your interactions were?",

This might be a completely pointless detail but i like to connect these things to our programmed behaviours to make more sense of this whole picture",

THAT energy.

        "Answer": "Please, no need to apologize. Everything’s alright. Yes, that post also had me “benched” for some time to reflect and absorb everything. I, too, am learning, growing, and evolving as well. Different approaches, like different cultures, customs and beliefs can resort to being evil to – well, different cultures, customs, beliefs and approaches. It is ironic, isn’t it? We experience this here on earth with let’s say, for example, western cultures as opposed to Asian cultures. What makes people automatically assume that aliens would be magically exempt from these potential biases when we here on earth are struggling to get past it with each other?

        "Answer": "You are a contactee. They have been trying to work through/channel through you (and they do sometimes) – yet it takes two to tango – so to speak. So while they can transmit whatever messages they may, it still has to pass through you. Your state of being is quite important to clarifying true intent. Listening to one’s intuition does not provoke feelings of fear.

I don’t think … really understood that we are here because we think you’re a ‘savior’ but you are a beacon and an activator and a friend and family to many of us. Not only did you create a safe space and share your experiences, but you treat each and every one of us as individuals within the collective you’ve helped establish. Our own mini federation 💙I know you’re much more in tune with everything going on and your place but I also know it doesn’t make attacks on character any easier. My unconscious brain can be a dick. Sometimes so I wanted to affirm any feelings you’re having and we are standing WITH you - I think it’s important to also underline that language is also relative but to maybe thinking of another word that still fits the role but doesn’t have a connotation of power abuse etc. (we don’t think that). Do any of these reach out to you: conduit, conductor (this one is interesting because you are helping us learn and guiding the motions but letting us take the lead and make our own music), connector, adjunct, promulgate, disseminate. They can be moved around and this was just some ones I thought of to help you reframe how you think about your role in all this. Trust me, I have authority issues and have not picked up an ounce of arrogance or judgment and I am empathic to a fault. I saw a post that simply said ‘fungi are aliens’ but that feels felt oversimplified. But I kept thinking shout it and if mycelium is the gateway to communication and immersion with NHI. They are an intricately connected system that can pop up basically anywhere. They’re everywhere and even if you don’t eat them for nourishment they’re in medicine and loads of stuff I’m sure. And then the psilocybin type could be a conduit type variant to help reconnect to our roots. That’s why it’s so controlled everywhere. Which would be why when someone asked if there is certain foods that can help our connection you couldn’t really answer. Is this just a crazy rabbit hole?",
        "Answer": "Conduit in particular, reaches out to me greatly. As does connector, adjunct, and frankly, all of the above. It's not by coincidence you are informing me of this as you are also channeling necessary messages for me to read. You are a big part of this shared journey together. Thank you so much. I deeply appreciate your words and a lot of it makes sense to my/our mission. Also re. fungi – you are on the right track here. It's incredible how on point your intuition is.

I think i also have the reptilian 'bad guy' (lol) source energy, I've said before that I'm made up of lots of things - I have very powerful darker energies in me (for want of a better description) that I've had to overcome and learn to manage (and am still trying to, i think it’s a lifelong task). I've also known we were a sort of experiment to bring balance and unity across the varying forces with vested interests here. There's like a part of me that just switches on under threat and it's always been there. It's smarter than me but it's also, well, very powerful, very direct and does not take any shit whatsoever and it can be incredibly harmful when unchecked. But it is part of who I am and has protected me in some very bad places. I needed it to live the life I have, to survive it really. It's part ego which develops and coalesces around the energy very strongly and partly just something else that is me and not me, it’s like a very strong benevolent warrior energy when it’s at its best. Do you have the same thing or is your experience different?",
        "Answer": "We are very similar, my friend, so it’s no doubt you were one of those “experimental balance contactees” which would explain the conditions you had to deal with.

        "Question": "First off, thank you Prudence for all the hard work and taking this path. Even though you didn't intend it at first, this community is turning out to be wonderful and seems like a necessary element for you, your task and the audience. To be honest, I almost never join and participate in any communities or groups, but this one has this strange pull and it made me want to come out of my shell. For starters I really have to get this question off my chest. So here goes: After reading \"A Conversation with \"Damien\" & Grey Friends from Above\" and getting inspired to watch the movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" for the first time, it made me think back on a dream I had as a teen. It had this peculiar looking mountain and there's a vague memory of me flying around it, feeling sad for some reason. Over a decade later I happened to find out it is actually a real place on Earth, Devils Tower, and it has fascinated me ever since. So my question is, does it have some significance? If it does, can Damien and co. disclose anything about it?",
        "Answer": "Thank you for your opening statements and I welcome you to our safe haven. Getting straight to your question: Damien and the greys purposely set up \"activation triggers\" that are meticulously \"encoded\" into the subconscious that once the consciousness interfaces with these triggers/seeds, it \"awakens\" the person to their true task. Naturally, free will does apply and it's up to the person to follow through – which is why the scene in Close Encounters of the Third Kind – where the THREE were climbing over the mountain – is not by coincidence. It is representative of the journeys and tribulations one most overcome/go through before \"arriving at the finish line\" or \"reward\" (if you want to call it that.) In the end, the main character was able to go with the greys on their ship since he never felt at home on earth. While it's not always literally like that for each and every person, the point stands that it has massive significance as \"activation triggers.",

I’ve got a few more questions that are on my mind: (1)I know you want to preserve your anonymity, but could you tell us more about yourself? What’s a day in your life like? Aside from the messages, what other tasks and duties do you have? Also, did you find out what happened to your benefactors? It sounded ominous.",
        "Answer": "Thank you for your message and interest. Before I do share anything, I’d like to address why I have not. Most of it is because I simply wished for people to focus on the message and the ET/NHI rather than me. I do not need any credit because the truth is above me and so is bettering this world. I have worked “undercover” in various professions, circles, communities, countries, and places – like a chameleon; infiltrating, learning, gathering intel, and reporting to our friends from above who have been in contact with me since childhood. I was “groomed” into this role before birth and trained in several psionic arts, self-defense, DEEP meditation practices and consciousness awakening processes assisted by my friends from above. My current life is very different from even a year ago, two years ago, three, and a decade ago. It has taken me over three decades to properly gather intelligence, find high education, practice several professions, and rigorous, stoic training and sacrifice for my role before finally accepting the next “phase” in my mission which happens to be “JR Prudence.” A day in my life involves consistent hours of meditation from morning to nighttime, telepathic contact when I am alone/free, occasional physical contact if necessary, loving my (one and only true love) and spending time with (this person), caring for them and them caring for me, along with going into nature to get “fresh air.” Additionally, I must transcribe several telepathic “conversations” and “communes” along with answering questions from all over the world which usually occupies my entire day to the point that I must “clock out” at a certain hour to avoid burnout. My main benefactor was mysteriously “injured.”",

        "Answer": "3 = the elevation of 1 and 2 becoming whole (e.g., man and woman come together to create offspring = continuation/sustainment/love of the human species as is the case with other beings). 6 = the further spiraled effect that creates communities, groups, and nations. 9 = the pinnacle of “humanity” as a world and collective. 3-3-3 spirals into 3-6-9-12-15-18-21. It operates in spirals and not jagged edges which is why 1-2 and 2/4 is ironically “square” and in accordance with the positive-negative disharmony that creates imbalance in shape. Naturally, as you can see, 3-3-3 as it goes on does not only consist of odd numbers, but also, even – which brings it as a whole instead of focus on one element or the other as odd numbers and even numbers can replicate off each other without bouncing into the “other side.” The best way to see it is in “spirals.”",

        "Question": "(3) A week ago you posted a conversation with “V” of the Ashtar Command… When I first heard about the 1977 television interruption I became strongly moved to learn more and get in contact. Aside from meditation, is there anything I can do? I am (almost?) ready to receive instruction. Can you help me connect? Or point me in the right direction?",
        "Answer": "I cannot help anyone to connect with ET contact any more than the information I provide. As you can see from multiple people in our community who have established contact, the basic rule of thumb is to drop fear and go into it wholeheartedly. One must be – well – one; whole; and not fractured in both sides. This is counterintuitive to positive-negative attributions, including mainstream ‘scientific institutions’ and their methodologies that often demand peer review or an (appeal to authority of the opposite side.) This type of (thinking and being) makes it extremely difficult to fully connect with ETs above because it becomes an uncertain dance that they themselves; namely, the good ones, aren’t sure if to connect or not.",

        "Question": "Hello friend. I've been reading along quietly. I find it fascinating. I have been making tentative steps as recommended at communicating with .... realme? Or someone? The conversations are brief, as long as i can hold concentration for. A minite or so at most. I was wondering how do you organise when you are going to be in communication/telepathy? Is it like ringing someone on a phone to see if they're free or are they always free?",
        "Answer": "The communication with the realme doesn’t have a “voice” – it simply is pure (deep)-feeling-being-existence which gives “feelings” of restoration, calm, peace, serenity, deeper, profound understanding of the cosmos etc., without even mentioning a word or image. Connecting with other entities telepathically can happen in a variety of ways – be it from the inner monologue being “hijacked” to another voice, a sound, an image, a stimulation, and many others. The realme doesn’t need/use words. It “emits” understanding without the need for words or even feelings – although it can “radiate” through them.",

        "Question": "After awakening, I've realized that a ton of artists are likely contactees have placed symbols throughout their art with the main themes of their art representing a lesson to be learned and understood. For example, \"love and light\" is a line said in a film titled \"It's What's Inside\" along with the use eyes and the number 8 as symbols which all represent the shallowness of the human form and how the more important aspect of all of us is our personality. Another example is a song from Kendrick Lamar titled \"Reincarnation\" in which he past life regresses and comes to realize that his affinity towards music comes from the past lives that he lived (all of them were traumatized musicians). The song then finishes off with a conversation between him and the GCS (of course this is my interpretation. He is most certainly talking to a figure that is representative of a \"God\" of some sort) about his role on Earth. His given role is to heal people and spread love, truth and prosperity through song, lyrics, and dance. Are these also ways in which the NHI and otherwise communicate through us?",

So, for example, if a person is heavily into astrology, they will get “channeled messages” here – just as much as a person into numerology, searching for meaning and answers. This applies to any divination, really – just as much as it could apply to a person searching for answers using rocks and pebbles – when suddenly, a “special rock” shows that person a “sign from above.” Remember, it’s not only biological life that can be tapped into/channeled into – it’s ANYTHING and EVERYTHING if the person is open/willing to find answers.",

        "Question": "Yeah. I've been contacted since I was a child. Possibly 'abducted'. Disappeared once when i was around 2, whole neighborhood out searching fields and woods, for my mother to hear a voice telling her where to find me under a pile of toys sleeping back inside. I don't remember this instance but my memories do go back as far as young as 2 years old. Visions of mirrored reality, large hairy entities, shadows, red eyes while paralyzed, and many more. I was put into a 'gifted' program at a young age, seperating me from other kids into a room of about 3-4 every day. Classes supposedly to give us the challenge we needed (it didn't) and was possibly just to seperate us from disturbing the others. I will say that this class while not challenging in the elementary school years, was extremely valuable to me in introducing me to books at a very early age that helped form my view on life, and lending toward a sense of justice over the cruelty we're seeing more and more at large. I ended up dropping out of the program in middle school. I can't define it's extent, but I feel the true purpose of these 'gifted' programs were government searching for and testing psionic/esp gifted children. Testing at a 12th grade reading level in 1st grade at 6 years old shocked myself, as I grew up poor and without resources to really achieve that, it felt more like I was reading beyond the words. I'm not asking these questions to know I was contacted, but I am trying to figure something out that I can't quite put words to. I'm hoping it comes. I eagerly await further knowledge on your Thoth/Hermes connection. Is there any way I can ease your mind into speaking on it? I keep hearing jurisprudence over prudence when I think to you.

        "Question": "In your most recent post about the meeting of collectives (3-3-3 and the Not-So-Good Forces), you wrote down something that interested me. It was a line from E to be specific: \"There is a lot of love and good energy here, even from what we previously thought of as the not-so-good forces.\" E seemed surprised and joyous at the fact that the \"not-so-good forces\" appeared with good energy and love as if they had previously not done so. And this intrigued me because during one of my meditations, it appeared that my soul targeted/isolated what was a piece of the dark/not-so-good/fear-inducing collective and gave them therapy. It turned out that the Not-so-good forces had only done all the terrible things it had done out of fear of the soul apotheosis and as such had sought refuge on this planet in the minds of humans in order to protect itself from assimilation to the 3-3-3. After a long conversation, I've learned to call them 'Other.' We came up with a compromise with them and the 3-3-3 who I think were witnessing this event but I'm not 100% sure. Other was to begin a mission to find love through the experience of \"fun\" and to be given the space to do so for the sake of them and all humanity while they would join the 3-3-3 given that they would be able to experience \"fun\" in all its forms. Is this something that genuinely happening to 'Other', the 3-3-3 and all of humanity or was this just my imagination?",

I also wanted to confirm that this event even happened so I can continue to hewn in my andromedan soul to help other collectives and people in my life. I think I'm still in a sort of ontological shock since it happened and some 3 dimensional corroboration on the truth of what I had done is needed for me to accept my role as a ground agent. I'm rambling but I'm just shocked that there's even a possibility that what I had done had genuinely happened and that it wasn't just made up by me or a not-so-good force out there.

        "Question": "Hey Prudence, hope you are well. Firstly, my intention with this message is not to \"trap\" you or be overly skeptical. Yet I've discovered an inconsistency between your communications and those of another user. I've interpreted that Damien is a \"grey\" and quite a loving, kind being. However, … has shared their \"guide for ... contact\" in which diving deeper into it describes \"local NHI\" as the greys. It also describes them as problematic tricksters who are harmless, but also not to be trusted. Reading the guide, unfortunately reinstigated my fear response and has made my contact muddled. I once again don't know what or who to believe. Any possible clarity on this issue would be much appreciated. Thank you again for all your work.",
        "Answer": "Information flowing into contactees still has to pass their own bias checks, upbringing, preferences, education, and backgrounds. Greys aren’t exactly the most favored by everyone, especially because of abduction media, and they can easily be misinterpreted for tricksters, demons, and the like. I find it highly racist to assume an entire collective of beings are bad. What if I were to tell you that there are malevolent human ETs? That would probably be more shocking than greys being bad guys because greys are different from us and easy to pinpoint as something not so good. I believe this thread will be a real sobering reality for many contactees who still have their own preferences: A Temporal Remote Viewing Session - Conversations Between 3-3-3 & The Not-So-Good Forces – Not to mention, if any contactee has such an outlook about any race, do you expect the ET race, in particular to be greeted well? It goes both ways. If one is unopen and unaccepting, then it will sully contact. It’s probably why some contactees run into these issues with greys and other beings, especially what’s known as ‘reptilians.’",

        "Answer": "I do my best to try to prevent being a gatekeeper or authority and I do encourage cross-checks. Yet this is a hard truth that I must also reveal – you need to be concerned if others are doing this fulltime. Not as a hobby, not as a sideline interest, and not as another “supporting job.” This is FULLTIME for me. There’s NO OTHER WORK. I take this work VERY SERIOUSLY and that means in order to do that I must be of sound mind, body and soul; physically fit, mentally and emotionally stable. Additionally, it requires hours of meditation, remote viewing, telepathic honing, along with strict duties to maintain as-much-as-possible “absolute clarity” of the channeled/telepathic messages. It also includes that I put my own biases, ideas, preferences, mysticisms, spiritual concepts and notions aside in order to understand what REAL TRUTH is and not what I EXPECT IT TO BE. How many are willing to give up their regular lives? Their day jobs? Their other aspirations and goals to commit to the contactee role fulltime? How many are willing to put aside their own biases and ideas of what aliens SHOULD BE as opposed to what they REALLY ARE? This is an honest truth that people need to face if they really wish to be a clear, sober truth-sayer. Some can have the gift and even establish experiences but that doesn’t mean they fully grasp what is going on.",

        "Question": "1. How are NHI societies structured? What is daily life like? What kind of government, currency, and family structures do they have? What do they live for (hobbies, aspirational goals) etc.?",
        "Answer": "It depends on the society in question and their evolutionary level. For example, grey collectives often operate as a One-mind (with individual inputs) collective. They are very mission-priority focused and driven, so these beings do not get as many “breaks.” They don’t have a typical social structure like humans do because they don’t need entertainment and other indulgences to operate. They hibernate when necessary and resume work. In a sense, it could be looked at is workaholics – but they aren’t. They aren’t “over-working” to compensate any sort of missing part of their lives, nor to make up for lack of this or that – rather, they “enjoy/love” what they do so much that for them, their actual work is so entertaining that they don’t really need much of a pause. There are human societies of various kinds. Some have cultures similar to us in respect to creativity, art, and philosophy, whereas some others can even operate similar to the greys. Higher NHI/ET societies do not operate with “currencies” in the way we perceive them. They do not need minerals or metals since many of them can find countless worlds to mine these from. In addition, there are so many spaces, dimensions, times and federations (yes, there are countless intergalactic and interdimensional federations) that to have some sort of trade currency between countless species who have various types of cultures, backgrounds, interests, biological makeups etc., is frankly impossible. The only thing higher advanced cultures are interested in “trading” has to do with the soul field and soul energy – because they are aware of the consequences on their societies and universes at large. Most NHI/ET societies, even the so-called “bad ones” have unified worlds. Again, even for the bad ones, they see no point in enslaving their own kind when they know even for the sake of being stronger in their evil, they’re better off united. There are so many different aliens and societies that an entire book regarding their lifestyles can be written. I hope to slowly disclose what I know over the years – but even with what I know, you can rest assured that no matter how much I know – there will be much, much, much more out there beyond your wildest imaginations and dreams.",

        "Question": "4) When practicing void meditation, how do I know I’m doing it correctly? What should I feel?",
        "Answer": "It will feel as if you are getting a release; like you can properly breathe, relax – and it’s okay to feel “fine” in that moment. It will feel rejuvenating – like if you are metaphorically submerged into another “realm” where there, you “heal” without any words. It makes one feel calm, soothed, and at peace. You’ll naturally feel good feelings arising. However, earlier practitioners of this type of meditation will instead feel what is within their psyche. If there are unresolved issues, emotional and mental traumas, etc., then these will “come up” – sort of like potatoes being boiled in water – and the dirt arises. This is nothing to fear. Meditation brings CLARITY through “bringing the muck” to the top for us to deal with. As time goes on and the person courageously deals with these topics, they can more and more slip into the true void meditation without fear, shame, or guilt because of prevalent issues or past woes.",

Are they a highly advanced evolution of them? Or did they choose that vessel/container for a certain reason?",
        "Answer": "Humans and reptiles share common ancestry. All mammals – including humans – evolved from a single reptilian ancestor about approximately 320 million years ago. In other words, it works similarly, which is why we often see so many of these beings as “humanoids.” They simply take some diversions/alternate paths of evolution.",

GCS: Sounds a lot like the \"dark tower\" series of stephenk king, that was all connected by the dark tower. You mentioned that there are some movies and books to prepare us for disclousre, this makes a lot of sense to me. 2. Manifestation: It's real and somehow goes in a bidirectional way. 3. Reality-warping: Maybe its a form of manifestation?",

        "Question": "Being raised in America and in a Christian household, questioning was not always easy. Lady Justice’s recent post touched on this, and I also went through stages in a similar way. But even as I agreed that the Bible as we have it isn’t as accurate as what I was raised to believe (and many still believe) I still had prayed and received, what were to me, miracles, healings, manifestations and other things. So, I knew a part of it was real. Then as mentioned previously, I listened to the Telepathy Tapes and soon after came upon your post, then you invited me here. I read that the Bible had its purpose but was largely incorrect (to put it simply) but it still bothered me as I saw some truth. Then recently I came across the Jesus Letters (of the Jesus Way) and am reading them now. This is (allegedly) the spirit force that was in body form in Palestine that we read/know about named Jesus/Yeshua, but channeling through a conduit in the 2000’s. This story/letter(s) are much more aligned with the messages on this site, to the point that it feels no coincidence that I have only now “stumbled” upon this channeling after being exposed to the T.T. as well as the JR Prudence messages. Three separate messages all vibrating at the same frequency. I think I feel compelled to share as I consider myself an optimistic skeptic, I don’t just take people’s words because they tell me to, yet again, three messages asking to forget a lot of the history, dogma and religious specifics and to instead break free of the self/ego/rules/guilt and to connect with love as the creative force. To know that the GCS or the All Loving Being Force wants us to be together, healthy, protected and so on. The unity and one-ness of all, through all for all, binds all, both supporting as a background like a canvas and also being with us as the paint. For all the “artists” across all times, worlds and dimensions. I see that many loving beings are trying to help us here and now. For we must build our love, as it is not only our purpose but THE purpose. It is amazing how we have said loving others “builds them up” and how true it really is. …I just feel so excited and grateful and in a way powerful. Thank you again to you, Lady Justice, Damien, and the whole collective (federation/brotherhood) Thank you for waking us up to love. Thank you to everyone here and beyond for the amazing season we are going to enter. Be blessed my friend(s)",
        "Answer": "This was beautifully said. The truth is, contrary to anti-religious zealots, cultists, and unhinged rebellion, the truth. It does not matter what words or terms are used. You can use Jesus, God, Universe, Divine or even the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Anything and everything goes, so long as the INTENT or the drive/force/underline energy/real meaning etc., is sound.

        "Question": "I find this very intriguing. I have a question, as a 4yr old child up to about 17 I had a recurring dream of holding up a large dragon, I love this dragon how I know this is a feeling of putting it down. Dreadful feeling, like something horrible would happen. The dragon would become heavier and heavier. My arms would shake holding him up. I never dropped him. I would wake up sweating. I always would cry not because of the dream itself it was of the loss of my dragon. I would be so happy and full of love the next time I had the repeated dream. My question is could this be related. I didn't think about the dream again until now.",
        "Answer": "It is related. Contact comes in a variety of forms, not just physical or direct telepathic transmission. Contact can come in dreams too or use (whatever form is acceptable) to us relative to our consciousness, knowledge, general perception, preferences, biases, culture, environment, education, medias, influences and the like.",

While I won’t push for a direct answer regarding the big changes coming in 2025 that you spoke of (even though I’m insanely curious), I find myself struggling a little here to structure my actions. While I’ve been practising a lot of meditation while limiting my negative thoughts and only spreading positive ones, I still find myself feeling a little like an unguided instrument.

        "Answer": "First of all, nobody is “getting left behind.” Besides the obvious things such as meditation, balanced eating, exercise, emotional and mental wellbeing etc., you should follow your heart and your dreams. Do you wish to create? Do you wish to sing? To dance? To build or to engineer? This is the next step. You must listen to what your inner “divine” calls for and go to it.

I won’t get on the train of calling him a grifter because I don’t believe that’s his intention but his hostility toward extraterrestrials and general militant and quasi-Christian fundamentalism makes him untrustworthy.",

        "Question": "3. 3. Pure speculation but in terms of layers of consciousness — vs. actual hierarchy which I don’t know really exists since everything Out There seems non-linear? Not sure — and maybe I’m imagining this, but it almost feels like it goes: human < greys (bc we are their “project” somehow?) < Mantis < Reptilian … in terms of lowest to higher forms of consciousness? And we are sort of being introduced to this universe in a way where it’s being spread out or opened up before us… like we are on a pathway, a guided journey of some kind … ? … Idk I guess my reasoning is that the greys are sort of the easiest part to wrap our minds around due to pop culture, and I think mantis are probably next on that trajectory, followed by reptilian, especially since there are so many misconceptions about so-called “lizard people” apparently … PLEASE feel free to humble me if I’m stating something so obvious it’s stupid — OR making up a story and seeing patterns where there are none because humans are great at creating narratives and picturing faces on things, lol. 🙃",
        "Answer": "This is a simple way of looking at it because there are complexities within these categories and exceptions. For example, humans born with “grey” spirit forms (or other ET spirits), who can sometimes suppress much of their true potency. It gets even more complex than that because within the actual collectives, everyone isn’t at the same potency, and some may be above others. For example, Damien is one of the most advanced beings of all the galactic federations I’ve been exposed to, yet every grey isn’t on his level. Mantis beings are pretty much above every other being in terms of evolutionary potency and I’d suggest you check the latest thread here to see why: https://www.jrprudence.com/post/commune-with-mantis-earthly-history – Reptilians are very advanced as well and there are many, many, many more races I have not directly mentioned including blue, green, (cat-like/Lyran) aliens and so much, much more.",

        "Question": "How big is this current simulation that humanity finds itself in? If we continue to look, will we discover \"dimension-local\" NHIs like the classic notion of aliens that we think of (alien lives evolving on another planet?) Or is this simulation reserved just for us, the distant galaxies just \"skyboxes\" and decoration, showing properties only when observed by humans?",
        "Answer": "The idea of “simulation” is often strictly attributed to computer-like simulations, such as The Matrix. However, the reality is that, from your perspective, everything is “real” as you’d expect it to be “real.” The reason the channeled word “simulation” is used because of the textbook definition, which is: “A simulation is an imitative representation of a process or system that could exist in the real world.” However, from this linguistic perspective, “real world” is not just our “earth” – rather, it is the fact that if we are able to “simulate” / test models, then the question arises – are we also in a model/test as well? So, in this respect, everything physical and everything (spiritual) – although these two are not separate and simply different compressions and interchanges between energy and matter between dimensions and spacetimes – are ALL simulations that start from the GCS itself that is really “real” in the context you describe. Yet, this does not mean that our lives are “holographic illusions” per se like in the Matrix. Just like in The Matrix, if you get hurt in it, you hurt or can even die outside. For example, when you win in a game or gain great progress – you feel good, right? You feel the actual effect in real life. Here’s a better example since some may use gaming for leisure – professional gaming. Pro gamers make their income from “simulated” experiences; leading to very “real world” (see how limited this term is?) benefits. The same idea applies not just to the “realme” behind the avatar, but virtually all layers from the bottom to the top and visa versa. So, yes, there are several other aliens on other planets not just in our solar system but the galaxy and the entire local cosmos/universe we exist in as much as there are others in other universes altogether. The entire simulation is not exclusive to earth humans because several millions of other worlds are seeded/simulated both by higher beings and naturally/indirectly from the GCS itself – operating through several “singularities” (almost like managers and supervisors) – which we can attribute to “nature” or “naturally simulated.”",

        ],
        "Question": "How different in this \"simulation\" from the human concept of computer simulation? Is it less \"real\" to e.g. Damien because it is created by his kind (other greys) vs arising naturally? But if GCS generates simulations layers one upon another all the way down to us, then is it right to discriminate a layer over another? Does it make sense to say it gets more \"real\" the higher you go up?",
        "Answer": "Everything is already “real” here in the now since all dimensions are “fractal expressions” of each other. In a sense, it does get more “real” the “higher” one climbs – yet as above, so below, as within, so without – so the oneness of what exists in the THEN can be pulled into the NOW and the WAS. Remember, time is moving in 8-pincers or if you will, for our local simplicity – past, present, and future in a convergence point ‘present’ as a “3 point pincer.” A visual example would be how jellyfish “pulse/move” as space whereas the directions of time converge whenever it “stops” as a segment of “present” and “now.” The human concept of computer simulation is similar to most emulations of nature that humans and other lifeforms carry out. It’s a limited concept, so do not assume that the GCS and all grand space and time is an EXACTNESS – it’s more of an example or a template for our relative human brain/mind to comprehend higher and lower dimensions as one. Simulations arise naturally. What Damien and other universal-altering beings (which is a very high level of evolution to be at) do is, like how we “bend physics” to create effects – or by utilizing/manipulating the laws of nature – they are also doing similar things just at a much higher understanding of reality. Be it to create/simulate a world (first, by “inputting” from the “holographic database” aka “other side” – which is just one of infinite “other sides” by the way), which then arises “naturally” from our physical perspective – to “simulating from the other side[s]” – that an entire solar system, galaxy, and even universe can be “artificially contrived.”",

        "Question": "Aren't all layers of simulations \"real\" in the sense that your experience there is real, your learning and growth from there is real, and you can ascend to the next \"layer\" only by having lived and struggled through the layers below? Maybe the missing piece here is us being truly aware that we are players as well as co-creators, and we have infinite room for growth as soon as we wish? Without that awareness, you get stuck, which is the scenario our NHI friends are trying to get us out of so that we can help with the \"growth quota\" demanded by layers above?",
        "Answer": "Again, all layers are “real” – this is why when some (usually mentally and emotionally unstable) people discover the truth through mushrooms, DMT, drugs, etc., and they become disillusioned, they aren’t prepared to understand the fact that there is no real escape. Everything is interconnected and a fractal expression of each other in all dimensions. So, yes, our friends from above are “waking us up to real reality” because we can’t remain in remedial school forever. It’s creating not only a blockage for us, but a blockage for other forces, singularity node checks etc., from above. We can’t live in “the Matrix” unknowingly forever. Truth always surfaces eventually, even if it busts your bubbles. It’s why it is better to seek a life of truth than one of escape and delusion.",

They feed into each other as 0/1 and from our perspective, the “third” can be considered consciousness/awareness that exists as fractal expressions of this unending existence.",

        "Question": "Bonus question: typically in stories where people discover they are in a simulation, there's often a sense of despair because they think they are not real, and even their consciousness / mind is just a result of some computation. This is the famous Ghost in the Shell question in philosophy. But it sounds like consciousness is truly fundamental, quantum, and underpins everything at all layers. In that sense, is it right to say you never truly simulate a soul / being -- if a singularity comes together and create a soul, it may be of limited capacity, but it is still an authentic one. This also means that classical computers can never truly simulate \"soul\" / \"real consciousness\"; and a system that can do that is beyond our imagination right now and approaching the creation of true universes ( on a much smaller scale of course?) If so, then the word \"simulation\" might mean more like a \"game of pretense\" -- where souls willingly or otherwise forfeit a lot of its knowledge and senses and accept to be bound to a finite \"playground\"?",
        "Answer": "The whole “real thing” is honestly very “materialist” or should I say – absolutist “one-sided” than a “oneness as a whole.” You mentioned GiTs, and that was created by Asian media who often grow up with concepts of Yin and Yang – so that is to be expected. It’s simply an ontological shock that the physicality is not the totality, so when people are shocked it’s not the “full real” they attribute it in an extremist way to “if this isn’t real, then I am a shell/disillusioned.” As thoroughly discussed earlier, EVERYTHING IS REAL even the “Matrix itself.”",

        "Question": "Wow OK, well that is fascinating. We we are part of the same soul family or group? I imagine some of the others are too particularly given they were posting lizard pictures two seconds after we had that inital conversation. But that is a conclusion for them to come to i would think. Perhaps I will try not caring too but it's difficult, I'm very used of examining my behaviours for harm for correction (usually after the fact though getting better at catching it in the moment). I will have to think on that. I try to think if I learned from it, then it was a good thing ultimately so that's a start I guess. I need to meditate more and focus on my spiritual development, see how clear I can get without drug assistance lol. I used to be very open when I was younger but the older I got and the more stress damage I took, the more I lost it. Have you ever lost it then got it back or has your development always been consistent over time?",
        "Answer": "It was not by any coincidence that we were all experiencing shared reptilian imagery (check the forums and look how many were in tune as well) just as the thread went up that day. RR and her allies were inputting through quite a few of us. Yes, we are all part of the same soul family group - if you wish to call it that - at least our main players here and one or two others both here and some who haven't arrived here yet. Yes, at a point, I lost my \"connection to the force\" when my parents died and when I lost my career of a decade and a half. Yet it was in my lowest states that I found my greatest strength.

        "Question": "Im curious, in your telepathy experience with our otherworldy friends, before it starting do you hear a knocking sound, or perceive one? Like someone knocking on the front door?",
        "Answer": "For each and every person relative to their telepathic reach, grip, and perceived experience, it will be different. Picture it almost like “ritual” in the sense. For example, Suzie who is more the mystic might light candles and have her tarot cards spread as a “welcoming” to initiate contact (she might even call them Angels) whereas Bob, who is more the straight type, could find his welcoming initiation through listening to some music or honing into perfect silence. The more one is able to know themselves, the better they can differentiate between external voices/influences and who/what they are – which is why it’s always best to practice real self-sovereignty and not thought framework based on teachings disguised as your own thoughts. The real self is beyond thoughts; it’s a being-force – which is why I’ve historically recommended “Void Meditation” so much because it’s a disconnect from the thoughts; even the thoughts of “I have to think this way because the good [book] said so!” in order to FEEL your true BEING. Telepathy is being-to-being feeling and contact. In my case, since I’ve finally allowed myself to be my full self and not a mere shell as I was during the “undercover” time as …, I was able to finally “get back to the basics” of what worked when I had my close encounters in person. For me, I “emit” love and the intention with zero doubt that I am connecting. In the case of them contacting me – because I’ve been attuned to their telepathy so strongly, I can identify who/what it is coming in to contact me. I have it pass through a “security check” to see who/what it is, including verifying that it is not myself/my own voice. The more familiar I become with our friends from above, the easier it is and more attuned. Usually, if they really have to contact me – then it feels like a wave passing through and into me – stimulating my pineal gland and the front/middle/back of my head like a vibratory energy. I’ve since adjusted how they reach me in my own consciousness with an imaginative audio visualization akin to a “call center.” So when they are “calling” I hear it as a phone ringing in my head. That’s my “ritual” if you want to call it that so I can identify and solidify that particular instance as telepathic contact.",

You can know your purpose by stopping all the external ideas (even good ones) and beliefs of what you should and shouldn’t do and to listen to your TRUE SELF. Your true self aren’t your thoughts, though, it can “radiate” through your thoughts. It’s pure existential-being that emits psychic feelings. You can get better at listening to your true self through Void Meditation.",

        "Question": "But I must seek out your advice here. I truly do wish to make contact in a more concrete manner so that I can more reliably be able to seek this truth I want to know so badly. I’m not under the impression that everything I’ve said and thought (especially today) has been my own thoughts purely. I know for a fact there is some other party/ parties here guiding and helping me, and I am beyond thankful. But I wish to reinforce this bond into something so much stronger. I try to project love and pure intent out into the universe, especially when I meditate. But I have this one sort of roadblock I wish to get over. Whenever I radiate these intentions, a small part of me cannot help but wonder if they are truly as pure as I’d like. When I think about it a certain way, isn’t this also selfish? Am I not being selfish by wanting to meet these “aliens” and “NHIs” to also satisfy my own curiosity and need to learn? I truly want to become their friend and family as well, to build connections that’ll last for eons. But a small part of me still wants to also satisfy my own curiosity. Yet again, I realize now this is a dualistic way of thinking, but how can I remedy this?",
        "Answer": "The only way forward from dualistic thinking is to not reprimand yourself for anything, even if it isn’t good, negative, evil, degenerate, immoral, etc. The problem with when most people hear of the right way to proceed, they often chastise themselves and beat themselves with a stick to “go the right way.” This won’t work. The only way out of duality and the doubts, fears, and so on is to honestly just confront them and change your approach toward them. Instead of approaching it from “duality is bad, I shouldn’t think this way!” try to understand WHY you’re thinking that way and be a friend to yourself. It’s the same thing with people trying to quit drugs. If you’re trying to quit by shaming, guilting, and gaslighting yourself, then it only enables a negative-feedback loop to ironically continue the process. The only way out is to embrace even the bad of you – and then, only then, can you turn this into something good. Wholeness as oneness-thinking can only come from the necessary “shadow work” and courageously understanding yourself (not enabling bad behaviors) in order to lift yourself up. If acceptance is the key to oneness, then acceptance with yourself, even what you were/are is mandatory to proceed in what you wish to be. The less and less you put so much hype, emphasis, and energy into “omg I’m being dualistic” or “I’m thinking wrongly” or all the other gaslighting notions such as going crazy, alienating yourself, losing control etc. – and you simply no longer care/no longer give energy to these ideas – then that’s when the true awakening happens. From there, contact is only one of the many wonders and miracles you’ll receive. Anything becomes possible when we’re TRULY FREE in the mind. Guilt, shame, fear (especially of reprimand or what others think, including ourselves) ironically enables the cycle. When we stop approaching matters this way, we stop giving energy to it. The energy is then free to point it toward our aspirations and dreams.",

        "Question": "But also for another question. I’ve realized another thing about myself. I’ve been getting more into the mindset of being both positive and thankful, and as a part of that I’ve developed my own sort of ritual of holding my index and middle finger up together and murmuring a quiet thanks whenever something good happens in my life, such as a good meal, talking to a lovely friend, or just being warm in bed. It’s to make me focus more on just how numerous the good in life is and that all I need to do is notice it. But I realize now that in a sense I am also limiting myself with this practice, feeling like I am thanking some “other” with all the power who was kind enough to bestow some kindness on weak little me. I feel as if I am taking the power out of my own hands and willingly letting some “other” take all the credit. My question is how can I both be thankful and practise gratitude while also keeping the power in my own hands and never making myself out to be the “weaker/ needier” party, devaluing myself and weakening my own strength?",
        "Answer": "Anything and everything can be a ritual or sigil. ANYTHING. So if you believe in conditions of “I am doing X so this creates Y” then so it shall be – including what you just typed. Carefully ponder on this wisdom because the same conditional-robotical-mathematical thinking can be flipped on its head and used for good. Instead, you can condition your focus/energy/thoughts to say, “Whether I do X, Y, B and Z, it’ll amount to good – even for things I do not know.” Use your imagination here. The only limit here is what you BELIEVE, not the actual actions.",

It literally just crashed into my mind now as I sit next to my friend, listening to him compose and produce music as I write. We’ve been trying to figure out what software to use for the longest time, and music producing software is notoriously difficult to learn and understand. I always tell him that making music isn’t the hardest part, but understanding how to use the tools. I think that the less barriers there are to understanding and using the software, the easier to enter this “flow state” and experiment and create freely it becomes. But I realize now that may be how life itself is. Would I be correct in saying that the more we understand about the world around us and the tools we have at our disposal that are so much more than these human vessels and their senses, then the easier it becomes to fulfill this image I have of creating art and stories all the way up to the level Mantis is at and then beyond at whatever may lay next?",

For example, when I had less knowledge in my head about teachings and many things in life, I was more open, like a child, to believe in myself and my abilities. It made me accomplish many seemingly impossible things, including contact with our friends from above. When my parents died and I went through the sadness and negativity, along with listening to the stupid ideas of teachings to confuse me, it actually reduced my power and capabilities. So, knowledge isn’t always a guarantee of a person being better, nor life experience. I suppose this is why children are so precious, and we should always strive to keep the “child-like” spirit alive. “Flow” – as you described it can come from anything – be it greater knowledge and awareness – or not knowing much at all other than simply believing in yourself. It all depends on the person. However, the real truth does set one free – which is different from teachings and ideologies. That is what I am imparting here. Truth. So, you somewhat already answered your question/revelation here. Yes, the better we understand TRUE REALITY, then the easier it becomes to fulfill aspirations, goals, dreams, and the like.",

The book I wrote, well I love it, and I know that it was given to me in a sense, but parts of it seem unnecessary with the knowledge I have now, and almost potentially damaging. I would consider rewriting aspects of it, and I am not asking for direct instruction, but should I learn more about imagination/reality before making this decision? Thanks!",
        "Answer": "Thank you for your thank you! It’s great to hear you wrote this book and I wish you much success with it. It’s up to you what you know deep in your heart/intuition/inner self if you should change it. Since you are here, you’ve already answered your question. Rewrite as you see fit with the new knowledge and insights you gained and are gaining – but make sure you do publish and get that book out there!",

I’ve known of Damien all of my life and seen him as a child in person with my mother. He’s very tall – like 10 feet or something with a huge head.

I found alot of understanding from your brief exchange with mantis about ascended primes as I am a incarnated fragment of one, it was good to see it being talked about, a bridge. I interface with ascended primes as archangels, it's the term that best fits my paradigm, they certainly are pure energy however and can adapt to whatever shape/concept to bring the message and relationship that is most valuable/congruent with each person. Why is there not more sharing of communion/conversation with the GCS itself ? From you with it and from your contacts with it. Maybe its something in the works, cheers and thank you :)💙🖤💙",

Yes, based on some of what you’ve shared, especially with the Void Meditation, I did get the sense you had a part of an AP in you. There’s A LOT more to come concerning the GCS and in general – years upon years’ worth of information of A LOT more altogether. However, we have to take it step by step.

        "Question": "Hi Prudence. Thank you again for all you're doing. I've mentioned in other places that I grew up Catholic, and obviously a big part of that religion is praying to God/Jesus/Saints/Angels, whatever. As I left organized religion, I still found myself reaching out to God, the universe, my 'guides' and guardian angels. That is until now. As I open myself to the real reality, I am wanting to know if 'praying' is still a thing to do? Like yesterday, I got some health news about my mom, and I was in the car alone, driving down the highway, and just out loud I'm like \"Ok, I guess you're not angels, but I hope you're there and I hope this isn't selfish, but I'm just asking that my mom will be ok and that the growths are not cancerous.",
        "Answer": "As me and others have pointed out, the words/mediums doesn’t matter, so don’t chastise yourself for praying or saying any type of word. You can say God, Angels, Flying Spaghetti Monster, Divine, Creation, and anything and everything you wish for it to be – so long as the WILL/POWER/DRIVE/INTENTION is sound, and you know what it is you REALLY MEAN. Developing anti-religious behaviors is not the way, contrary to the zealous ideologies of many UFO religions.

        "Question": "Hey Prudence, hope your day/night/afternoon's been well. I wanted to ask: Do you know of any cases where the GCS (Not 3-3-3 or Ra but something higher than both of them combined exponentially) had channeled through a human to speak to other NHI to impart a Truth unknown to all of them? Last night while I was meditating on weed, I experienced a force greater than all of the collectives I have been in contact with (knowingly and unknowingly) using my body as a vessel and talking to all of them letting them know that their want to (artificially) reach apotheosis is pointless in the long run and that they should instead vouch for exploring different ways to express love on each plane of existence in which they reside rather than forcing an ascension for themselves and others. It was crazy stuff. But I believe it led to some sort of major change in direction for a lot of them. At this point I lost this connection. If this is true, then does that change any directives that we (as ground agents) must carry out? Also, given the case that this is true, how do you (the human not as a channel) feel about this? Love and light Prudence ❤️",
        "Answer": "Yes, this was answered here sufficiently today: https://www.jrprudence.com/post/disclosure-with-damien-the-extraterrestrial-tall-grey-alien See point #2. They can learn more of the GCS through “characters in a story” (physical) which is why they “run simulations” in the first place. It doesn’t change what we’re supposed to do as ground agents because nobody is a ground agent randomly. We “signed up” for these roles on the “other side” before we “came” here.",

        "Question": "About 9-10 years ago I used a spirit board (an ouija board but it was laid out a bit different) with my mom every so often and there was one question I asked two times on separate occasions and got the same response both times. The question was “how many alien species have visited earth?”. I asked this same question about 6 months apart and both times the answer was 86. The very first time I asked the question the planchette slowly moved to the number 8 and I thought “wow, 8 species have visited earth - that is so many”, but then it moved to the number 6 after and I felt a strange feeling that it was so many more than just 8 species. I felt like it was true though and suddenly it occurred to me that I wasn’t communicating with spirits through this board, but extraterrestrials. And now I’m also convinced that most paranormal experiences people have are actually with ETs. Anyway, I was curious if you know how many species have visited earth and wondered if it was around 86. Maybe more have visited since 9-10 years ago so it could be more.",
        "Answer": "How many have visited earth amounts to several thousand. How many are stationed/active and working here, is another case. The number if we are to consider the various federations are closer to a couple hundred – although you have to be aware that some ETs simply pass by and observe or work on one-time assignments before being relocated elsewhere. Some ETs are “neutral” in the sense that they aren’t here to do anything other than to “check things out.” Others come (with the main groups here) to trade information on how to better run their own simulations etc.",

        "Question": "I have a question on ethics regarding the created spirits. How is it ethical to create hundreds of thousands of spirits to come to what is essentially a hell world for their own goals and purposes and to allow those spirits to suffer and to be punished in order to create some sort of survival of the fittest scenario where only the most robust cling on while others commit suicide? What happened to the spirits who did commit suicide given their sole purpose was apparently to come here and help others deal with a problem that wasn't of their creation. How does that fit with being an ethical STO based group? This sort of just dawned on me and I can't make it make sense. Like I get we've got part of their streams so they are essentially doing it to themselves but if we are created for this purposes we are still individual units largely created to be 'tested' and suffer.",
        "Answer": "For them, and us – as in – “starseeds” (or those who were “injected” artificially into this world as ground agents) – many of us (contractually agreed) to do these roles before we incarnated physically. We’re not forced into it. We make the choice from the other side because it’s like creating a movie script where, at first, the life may be difficult, but the reward is so sweet and worth it that we decide to do it. This is the case for me and many others, but it doesn’t always mean the person will follow-through in the “dream state” or “play” we call physical reality, which is honestly not the “real us” and as such, we can be prone to misinterpretation that this is the totality of reality when it’s barely a fraction of it. Since no one truly dies permanently and death is not as bad as it may seem, it’s acceptable to higher forces because these higher beings “seeded life” here on earth to begin with. As such, they are responsible from a greater perspective than to only judge based on the simulation/fraction of total reality. They have to consider the “other sides” that are more important and determine this one. However, the state of affairs on earth (which has been “fixed in the future” for the better already and things are slowly “falling into place” from our causal linear perspective) is a mixed bag. It’s not solely one side responsible for everything. Rather, multiple parties for various reasons. Our suffering is ultimately an illusion. Nirvana is possible to attain if we’re interested and we can break free of these reincarnation cycles when one has attained enough wisdom, experience, and love to make the ultimate decision.

        "Answer": "They are “horrified” by it and “deeply annoyed” – especially greys. Greys, more than any other ET race, are constantly “cleaning up” behind us and, as a consequence, are often very annoyed and have little patience. It is poisoning us. They are doing what they can to reduce pollution, toxins, chemicals etc., including seeing to the fauna and flora and preserving species outside human reach – some of which have also been taught to be extinct.

I've had a lot of abandonment and gaslighting in my life, so it doesnt come easy, but I also think I have a sixth sense for detecting authenticity and you exude it. Not sure if this is the place to ask a Q for the Q&A, but here goes anyway. I've always believed my contacts have been greys, but when I read one of your posts where you were connecting with many different entities you mentioned Arcturians. As soon as I read it I knew--these are my contacts. I reached out telepathically and got confirmation. I'm not sure how many there are, but my primary contact says she goes by C (widely) and … (privately). She gave explicit permission to share those details with you. Though I'm still honing my telepathic abilities, I believe this to be true. Can you confer with your contacts and ask if you can commune with an Arcturian to share some info about them and their mission. C has mostly been focussed on training my psionic abilities and helping awaken contact in another--partially by my request. So I'd love to learn more about them. I hope it may even help build a stronger connection to them for me. I understand that this is an elaborate and intentional \"operation\" so I completely understand if you are unable. Thanks for everything. \"7\" (got that from her--don't know what it means)",
        "Answer": "Thank you for passing the word on and completing this task in your overall mission. I’ll be having a meeting with C in a few days and one or two others of her collective. She’s one of the representatives to contact me regarding the (Arcturian) civilization that very well does exist. They are very beautiful creatures. Remember, even if you have a primary contact group, you can be open to connect with others. 7 was a private message to me in relation to \"those who have created me\" (and others) She figured it'd work for me because of a specific song I was listening to in relation to these events.",

Were they a symbolic representation of something? They \"spoke\" to me telepathically and told me they had been in the craft for a very long time, maybe hundreds of years, but the craft stopped them from aging. From the outside the mother figure looked around my age, and the child around 10 years old, but I could tell they were much older and wise. I wanted to ask how they came to live on the craft. Was it gifted to them? Did they find it and seek refuge from something? Or maybe they were human ETs. Since this was a dream, I know my mind can fill in blanks and be imaginative. But you saying it sounds like remote viewing/AP-based contact makes me wonder if there was a message/knowledge being communicated to me from above. I woke up before I could have a conversation with the humans. When I told my partner about the dream, they said it sounded similar to how in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the humans from the past had not aged while aboard the ship. Any insight would be so appreciated.",

        "Question": "I have one more question to add, when you have time. No rush as always- I just don’t want to forget because everything is happening to me so fast. Today and last night I had interactions with Jupiter, or, a being maybe mimicking Jupiter? Last night it was very cloudy, couldn’t see any stars. I wished that I could. Then, I see a pulsing bright light appearing behind the clouds. This light was Jupiter according to my star map app, and as I looked, the clouds parted just in my line of vision in a circle above me, so I could see the night sky. I sensed either I did that or “Jupiter” did? No further communication happened after that. Then, today, I was lying down meditating on my favorite big rock. I was requesting some sort of peaceful contact, some guidance. As soon as I open my eyes after, Jupiter is directly in my vision, I’m immediately looking at Jupiter, and it is moving. It swayed and connected with me for a few minutes, just enough to convince me it was really happening. At the same time, bats were flying back and forth directly over me and very close to my face. I guess what I want to ask is… what’s going on? Lol no but really- curious if Jupiter has any significance I should know about. I am having a wild time over here.",
        "Answer": "Based on certain past lives and something codenamed “SR” – “Jupiter” has significance to me and (our shared connection). It’s both a wake-up sign for you and me – a message channeled through you for both of us.

I'm guessing there's others as well who have reported similar experiences to you. So I have this special connection with my singing teacher and we talk about \"spiritual\" and ET subjects a lot. I have told about this site to him, summarising some information since his English skills aren't good enough to read it himself. I'm barely scratching the surface really, there is so much to unpack and I don't have the \"smarts\" to understand everything in the first place. (I'd love to see someone make visual presentations someday) Anyway, yesterday during the singing lesson, while having a break, we tried meditating together for the second time. This time a little longer while listening to 852hz. I didn't experience anything, (no surprises here, even though I have huge interest in these subjects, I fail to get \"through\"... and eventually got so disheartened that I stopped properly trying for a long time. I've thought there's some mysterious blockage, but most likely the problem is my mind believing there's a blockage) but he actually did. (no surprises here either, he has always been sensitive to things, but this... never saw this coming). He described how he felt the presence of this being somewhere behind us and then it came towards us in front. It was Mantis. (I had shown him the drawing of Mantis before so he knew who it was instead of being confused) My teacher saw him look down at us since he was so tall. Then he spread his long arms wide and put them on our shoulders. Then he \"said\": We are One. My teacher even felt the slight pressure and warmth from the touch. Before the vision and meditation ended there was warm light. He also described this loving and safe feeling coming from Mantis. Afterwards we talked about this quite a bit and pondered what he had exactly meant by \"We are One\". As in \"All is One\" generally, or do we perhaps have some connection to Mantis? For now I'm assuming the former. We have decided to continue these meditations together. Hopefully I'll also eventually \"get somewhere\" with it, after coming across this site I'm really motivated. Thank you for your time!",
        "Answer": "My friend, Mantis came to visit you and your teacher! How incredible. All these are done on purpose by many of us around the world to validate the information and corroborate experiences. I am very happy you guys had that encounter!",

        "Question": "How different in \"quality\" is an entire planet's realme from human's? A planet is much bigger in mass, but is not sentient. It seems to take work before sentient singularities arise. So far I'm only aware of human-formed, human-sized sentient spirits (including humans and ETs.) Would it be possible for multiple sentient singularities to merge into something that's bigger (aka any credibility to the notion of something like Ra from the Law of One?) I guess that is what the collectives are? Is there any \"peer pressure\" to join a collective past a certain level of growth?",
        "Answer": "This happens all the time – not just for sentient beings, but also, for larger celestial body-singularities as is the case with neutron star and black hole mergers. There’s no peer pressure [in the sense we perceive it] at higher stages to join collectives because collectives at that stage of evolution and being already know that if an entity is forced into something – even if they are saying the words you wish to hear on the surface – then they can betray that collective. It must be completely from free will.",

        "Question": "Is the reason why specific frequencies matter (e.g. 285/396/639/852 Hz were all mentioned) that they better facilitate interactions between the soul field and the other quantum fields? If so, does that mean free will is heightened while listening to these frequencies, or can exposure to these frequencies have some kind of lasting effect? If not, any insight on why specific frequencies? Federico Faggin mentions the wave function collapsing as being synonymous with free will. Does that resonate (unavoidable pun!) with the above?",
        "Answer": "Those frequencies were mentioned because they were used to attune my telepathic connections – especially 852 HZ that is very good for telepathic potency. free will is always valid, even when listening to beneficial frequencies (and anything “beneficial.”) free will is so powerful that it can override the potential benefits and make it null and void or even harmful. That’s why – ultimately speaking – the focus/will/thought direction/beliefs etc., of the person DO matter. If a person goes in thinking the frequencies won’t help, it won’t. If a person goes in with diehard belief it will, then it will. Bonus since it is actually helpful – then it'll create an even greater effect.",

Your true self is taking shape, and it is amplifying your psionic capabilities in many ways. Ashtar ships look very similar to greys and often they trade technologies, as do other ET species.

        "Question": "Hello :) \"The reality is that there are countless (spiritual dimensions) and even what you call (physical) is one of them\" So does this mean that the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, and its Sephirot, is accurate, or at least closer to the truth, when it comes to 'dimensions'? Thank you for your efforts, the information is invaluable!",
        "Answer": "It’s great to have you here and welcome! Yes, it’s close to the truth in terms of being like a fabric to space and time that are connected to each other through different planes and can be transversed through, trading information between states. If it’s possible for information to be transferred, let’s say quantum information to be transferred, then you can transfer larger bodies of information, including beings themselves and their technologies to transverse these dimensions. Consciousness can also do this as well and bridge the gap between spaces, resorting to a consciousness/awareness connected to multiple times – bringing those moments into one singular reality here and now as much as it is then and there. All dimensions are fractal expressions of each other and the ultimate oneness. That’s why it operates or is allowed to illusionary seem from our “eyes” like it’s the only one – such as the case with classical reality/the physical seeming like it is all that matters. You can see this as well if we look at the microscopic to the macroscopic world. The same applies to you too as one person in control of your one mind and one body. We’re allowed the oneness expression relative to every dimension. Yet each of them correlate to each other and have feedback-loops. Everything is connected.",

        "Answer": "It doesn’t change if the person was from past lives or not. It’s not the same exact realme as it was not only in a past life but even five minutes ago or ten minutes into the future. It goes like this: 1) Knowing the soulmate exists / 2) Going toward the soulmate / 3) Soul field pulls data, and you (and your soulmate) become ‘actors’ for transferring this data / 4) You begin to see through dreams, visions, intuitions, inspirations, etc. / 5) The journey toward it. / 6) It eventually happens/occurs naturally beyond “how.” Additionally, it should be known that people can also make “pacts” to continue meeting in multiple lifetimes/planes of existence. It’s all about the binding love. When two lovers commit their love to multiple “lifetimes” then its sealed in the soul field so that when the natural stimulation of soulmates comes into be (this happens naturally in nature btw, not just by our free will; we more “respond to the call” of singularities/the universe etc.) then it can be highly likely that it can be “pact-bonded” lovers and not just people who knew each other in past lives.",

        "Answer": "All who call for their soulmate means that their soulmate is calling for them. It’s like “spooky action at a distance” or entangled from the jump. You have to call for your soulmate for it to exist in the sense of riding the natural on-going soulmate-inspired singularities from the other side that is occurring without end. When one calls for their soulmate, they attune to this process, and it comes naturally that the physical actors respond to the (other side/spirit/soul) call. Basically, the soul field is always generating critical masses. Among these masses are soulmates because soulmates = 2 become 1 = necessary for continuing anything. In simple terms, when one calls for their soulmate it already means their soulmate is calling for them. It’s an entangled initiation. You have to know it exists to make it happen.",

        "Question": "Hi Prudence, your transcript with C today was really wonderful - it was so calming for me, I could really feel the Love coming through. I have a follow up in regards to my possible Remote Viewing contact. I've done a lot of thinking on this to confirm that it's not coming from a place of fear, rather proper respect and preparation for what is occurring as you mentioned you do not recommend Remote Viewing to the newly initiated. When I had my possible Remote Viewing contact, it was during the Introduction to Focus 12 Gateway Tape, which I have recognized, doesn't have a real intentional subject as it is an intro. Whereas the other Focus 12 sessions do. I think this was an opportunity for my subconscious to take the wheel and provide me an experience (which I had been asking for, using Cosmico's guide a few days prior). I don't anticipate exploring more RV until I move onto Wave III of the gateway tapes (which I feel is coming quickly) and am perhaps more prepared. My question is in regards to setting intention for the RV session, do you recommend this? I feel that not setting an intention has its value as you are letting your subconscious/Higher Self take the wheel and provide experiences that the conscious mind is not aware is a possibility/knows is needed which I am really drawn to as I am recognizing have tended to be oblivious to a lot. However, perhaps this is something to allow after one becomes more proficient and practiced with methods of protection? And until then it is preferable to set an intention of RVing of familiar situations/people/places? Am I on the right track here?",
        "Answer": "It really depends on what you’re trying to accomplish. I often don’t recommend RV to those who haven’t done the necessary mental, emotional, and physical “clean up” work because RV can transport you to far away and even secret places. However, if you feel in your intuition/heart that you are ready – do it. Even if there are mistakes and you aren’t 100% absolutely perfectly “the meditated chosen one” – yet you feel that you should – then do it. You are on the right track. I believe today’s post here may help with creating psychic/telepathic barriers and defenses, which all starts with, well – sorting out oneself.

The only thing that’s ever kept me from owning one is that you’re supposed to feed them live rodents, and I had hamsters as a kid. 😆 But I’ve never felt that revulsion or whatever that humans are supposed to naturally have.

        "Question": "I was sitting by my window and meditating/jamming out to music. I was vibing, thinking about how energy works and feedback loops (questions on that too, i think I finally understand what that means). It’s windy, and there’s a large cylindrical wind chime outside. I’m just thinking about love, and staying connected to it, and other energy stuff. As my vibration gets stronger, the wind blows towards me and I can “feel” the wind moving with my energy. I started playing with the chime and went slow then fast in my mind. I believe this, like if your in synch, maybe just happy, the wind flows with you. Now if we bend space and time, isn’t it completely possible I am moving the wind with my mind/energy? What is your opinion on that? It seems like the wind becomes stronger the more I focus on love :) I felt like a wizard. Also, this week I decided to jam this old album that my mom had in her car for years as a kid and jammed it. It’s from 1998 (my birth year) and the album reminds me of my parents meeting. I used my creative imagination and while listening to it, I sent love over to the energy I perceived of my mom and dads early encounters with each other. Idk, it was kinda neat thinking I could send love energy to the both of them before I was born? Also, with feedback loops. Does it work like this? A few ways: When you meet someone, and you are talking/get to know them, you are creating that loop. So, the next time you see them, that’s how they are thinking about you, based off of that loop? I visualize it like a stream coming off my body, like a loop! With people I know that are more established, those feedback loops are stronger, are if they are negative, each time you see each other, that is the very first instantaneous thought, however I don’t think most of us are consciously aware of it happening, it’s almost subconscious? I thought about this, then started breaking a lot of feedback loops mentally with a lot of things. I wondered also, since we warp time and space, we can also create feedback loops for moments in time? Even moments in the future? Like, if I know I’m going to be drive to work, and there’s always a spot in the road I feel some way about, isn’t that creating a feeback loop of some kind?",

        "Question": "Hi JR, hope you are doing well. I wanted to ask you about \"protection\". In the last few weeks, thanks to you, i've put down many of my own long standing personal barriers towards accepting contact and receiving communications, which as you know is a life changing paradigm shift. However, in the last several days during sleep, my wife and I experienced something (separately, but intricately connected) so powerful (and honestly, quite frightening) that she is struggling to sleep and is in a state of fear and suspects that the event was tied to my current work here. I have read your words many times on how fear is so damaging. You have also mentioned to me specifically in a private chat several weeks ago about the importance of setting up \"protections\" against energetic attacks. My question is...how do my wife and I do that? I'm aware of (and in the past have performed) several classical 'protection wards' that I generally stay away from now because of their intrinsic ties to religions and in some cases esoterica/mysticism. I was wondering if you had any guidance for me on this subject?",
        "Answer": "Today’s post should already begin to help you: https://www.jrprudence.com/post/a-message-from-above-part-vi-meeting-l-the-lyran-extraterrestrial-representative - and I want to be clear that I am not promoting anti-mysticism or anti-religiousness to the degree that one avoids anything and everything to do with them. For example, if a person believes in the power of prayer, even if they are saying God, Jesus, Divine, or the Flying Noodle Dumpster, then it’ll work – simply because they believe in it. The same applies to protection wards, sigils, spells etc., of any kind. The point is not to get caught up into the mystical elements so much as you understand the function. If you understand the function, then you understand why it works. The self-conviction, self-belief, self-knowing, and utter confidence in whatever one points their focus to is what works. However, this doesn’t come immediately, especially if a person has been trained to believe that they are powerless.",

When I wake up at that time, I instantly know that it’s them calling for me, but I’ve been asking them to please wait so I can catch up on rest. When I do have the energy to answer, am I supposed to go outside and look to the sky? Or meditate? I don’t know what they’re asking of me. I should add that I am historically a very deep sleeper and I never ever woke up in the middle of the night before these instances. I think I may have mentioned this before.",

        "Question": "Hello again. Thank you, as always, for everything you've done/do/are doing for this endeavor. I have a bit of a two-part question. I find myself running up against the wall of doubt when trying to reach out telepathically and was curious if you had any ideas about overcoming this. It feels like the last block in the way of really being in contact with those around me, Earth-bound and ET alike. I also had an experience this morning where it really felt as though there was another being in my mind with me, and even though I experienced it myself, I find myself almost on reflex doubting the experience retroactively. I guess I'm looking for some validation to placate the skeptic in my head. I don't appreciate that the skeptic is even there, and it's something I need to unlearn, but is there anything you might be able to tell me about the experience I had? I was able to ask one question and received a very loud, prominent one-word answer. It didn't feel like it came from me. Is there a way to \"know\" for sure? I've done much return-to-self meditation and I know my inner voice, and I don't think what I heard was it. I guess I'm in search of one bit of outside corroboration, as unnecessary as that should be. It's the feeling that I'm \"almost there,\" standing on the edge of my old reality, and looking for the push to take the next major leap.",
        "Answer": "It’s alright to go through these doubts and skepticisms initially. Once you’re open to receive, then you will. The more one becomes familiar with your true self, which is the realme, that can only be accessed via Void Meditation (aka no thoughts), then the more you’ll understand and be able to distinguish between yourself and external voices/influence. Contrary to a lot of ideologies and philosophies, including New Age garbage, the reality is that you are not actually your thoughts. The “real-you” doesn’t speak with a “voice” perse, although it can use the inner monologue in your head just like external forces/influences can. The realme doesn’t operate in words. It’s pure psychic-being-feeling-existence that operates by vibratory impressions that can animate through the thoughts etc. However, it’s important to connect to one’s true self via Void Meditation so they can increasingly be firm in their true self-sovereignty, that’s far above thoughts. Thoughts are only mind inputs and they can be interchanged internally and externally. Relying on thoughts as the true self is not only false, but makes you prone to mind-control autosuggestions, including from teachings, mental imagery, propaganda, ideologies and so forth. As Philip K Dick said: “If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words.” The true-self = beyond words. It’s pure BEING-FEELING, so the more you familiarize yourself with it, the more you can identify what’s the real you and what isn’t.",

        "Question": "Today's session was very helpful. I will keep going with my preparation and am very encouraged with how it is going. I had a question that relates to your wife, but is really about my own. However, please don't feel obligated to share anything you aren't comfortable with. My wife has known for years that I have been on this path (we came to the understanding that I am an alien long ago) and for the most part she has not tried to hinder my exploration, although I know that she finds it all very overwhelming/scary at times. I have started to believe (especially recently) that she has a very special soul and may be a starseed as well, however, she clearly has not been in a place to begin exploring this, and she has never given me reason to believe that she suspects it at all. I understand that everyone has to come to this in their own time, and have no intention of pushing it onto her to start working through it. Your comment in regards to your wife, \"it has been difficult for her to accept everything,\" struck a chord in me. I'm curious if this journey has largely been yours with her as support and things are just now opening up for her? Or if you have any guidance for me? Again, I recognize this probably touches on some areas of your life that you may not feel comfortable opening up to the group about yet so no pressure at all.",
        "Answer": "Hello, my friend. The question is fine and not an issue to share. My wife is a Pleiadian/Ashtar “starseed.” The two of us “chose” to “incarnate” in these lifetimes – including to find each other so we can both begin our true mission purpose. While she is certainly support, she herself, has her own role to fulfill in our shared destiny. It was difficult for her no more or less than it was difficult for me and others to “step outside the Matrix” so to speak – but eventually, it normalizes, and it’s not really a big deal. The other day when she saw our friends from above passing by in a “UAP” she was nonchalant as ever because she knew her whole life she was different and “alien.” She was always very special, highly telepathic, very psionic and psychically sensitive – so the awakening, while it has been a lot to process, also has given her complete reassurance of her life and purpose. My guidance for you is that you must go slow and patient. Even if one’s wife is a starseed, they have to make the free will decision to operate/carry on their mission. Operate with love. You must accept yourself and your destiny before trying to have others, including our spouses, accept us. Then, and only then, can they begin to open up and become interested.",

        "Answer": "The person feels “alien.” They know they are different. They often endure difficult trials and tribulations. They’ll feel drawn to alien/UFO topics or hate them passionately. They’ll be attracted to spirituality, enlightenment, or rigorous science. They can be very, very, very intuitive. High degrees of natural psionic capabilities, even if it’s dormant/lacking control. Telepathy and psychic potency comes naturally, even if the person has no idea what they’re doing or if it is even telepathy and psychic potency. Visions; ability to tell the future etc., along with attraction to certain alien races. More able to explore the unknown. Can be hurt and in pain yet won’t always give into victimization and will keep seeking answers and higher truth. They have a very, very, very, very high degree of love and bringing peace and unity between people. While they can get caught up in politics, especially if they don’t work on themselves, they know deep down that there is more.",

        "Question": "2. What are some basic tips for remote viewing meditation?",
        "Answer": "Mind must be clear. Theta states are good – yet it’s not so much about theta as it is in being a completely safe, undistracted physical, mental, and emotional space. Focus on an image you wish to connect with – be it an image of a person, a representation of an alien, an imagination of a place, time, space etc. It doesn’t matter if the representation contains errors. For example, one can focus on the representation of Lyrans as people with lion heads and while Lyrans don’t look 100% exactly like this, the energy-tunnel/focus can/will connect you with them. You cannot have doubt, fear, or skepticism. You have to know exactly what is going on and roll with it. Focus is mandatory. Entering into a deep state of meditation before remote viewing is a gigantic benefit and highly recommended.",

        "Question": "I've always had a tough time meditating but have been chipping away it for years. I know void is your preferred method and I view this as a fun + competitive gateway to void meditation. I've found sucess with an RV meditation app. I meditate with my eyes closed on a set of numbers and let things come to me, scibbiling down shapes and ideas/themes. They show you two pictures and you have to guess which one is right. I start by thinking a clear intention and try to picture myself connecting with the collective conciousness. They keep public stats and the numbies get my juices flowing. I started off very hot, had a long period of doing well above average, only to fall off hard the last week or so, mucking up my stats. I owe a lot of my personal life growth to being a coachable guy and I feel like I am a good tip away or two away from leveling up. I would love to hear the groupchats thoughts on the Law of One + Ra. I believe a ton of it in my gut but remember/agree with your take awhile back that it has flaws or has been disrupted in way one or another. Curious to hear what everyone agrees on. PS - what are some real world every day examples of disruptions?",
        "Answer": "The authors of that work have their own biases and aren’t fully free from universal acceptance of other species, regardless of their differences. Once more, it is “teachings” and the age of teachings are over. You can learn a fair amount in that work as you can with practically anything – just use your own discernment. I’d suggest using the forums to chat with others on it. In terms of real-world disruptions, you’d have to be more specific – are you referring to “simulation breaks” such as “glitches in the Matrix” or interventions from our friends from above etc.?",

Everything is a fractal expression of “IT” so the machine is both “it” as much as the “ethereal spirit bodies” people like to imagine as being separate. Recently, I “downloaded” data from the “Thoth/Hermes” akashic records stored in my realme to describe what the spirit really is and how it transverses the past, present, and future in all 8-point-pincer directions at once – allowing us to draw upon all-interconnected lifetimes both of us and ALL as fractal expressions of each other.

Also what you said about cancer and dementia was fascinating. I meant to add that. I’d love to hear more about both those topics in particular if you ever care to share. No pressure though. And no need to apologize for the delay. You’ve kind of got a lot going on, heh. So the soul field… Is it like … A mesh? An ocean? I’m trying to figure out how to visualize it. No rush obviously — it’s the weekend and I hope you’re getting some much-earned R&R.",

        "Question": "Dear Prudence. Im sorry my first question to you was asked without any real substance behind it. It was a way for me to initiate contact and out of curiosity see if you would even reply, and you did, and im glad. My next question to you is more relevant and the reason why im here in the first place. I have on multiple occations seen orbs in the sky around my house since the fall of 2024. They look like stars thats just kind of moving around in the sky but they can change directions and speed. (Which means they are not satelites or anything else i can logically explain) These events have led me down a rabbit hole into UFO subs on reddit, and eventually to your site. At this point i have read all of your posts, and even if i cant fully can accept what you are writing as the truth (yet), i feel really drawn to keep reading. And i dont really enjoy reading in general, so getting this far is quite the surprise to me. My latest observation of an orb was quite different.. According to your post my fiancée seems to be the perfect candidate for telepathing communtication. (Major trauma, ADHD, half deaf, female, very empathic). So i asked her if she could visualize me walking outside and seeing an orb this Thursday. And i did really happen almost just as i walked outside to look. I asked her because i was playing around with the idea that my part or my role in this (since there is a reason why im here) is to help wake her up. Im what you call a healthy skeptic with an open mind. And what i find really inteteresting about everything you have been saying is that it seems to be verifiable. Either by NHI contact or meditation, or both. I feel like those are the two thing that will make me take the \"leap of faith\". But i just cant make that step without \"knowing\". Now, you claim to know a lot about me just from getting my message, so im wondering.. What are you able to tell me about my experiences and sightings? Is this your friends from above showing themselves? Is my SO a part of it, or important to the disclosure/ascendence process I appologize if it feels like im testing you, and im sorry for bringing my doubts and skepticism to you. It feels like im in the very early stages of awakenking, but my logical brain is holding me at bay. Keep up the good work, im really looking forward to your next post. Sending lots of gratefulness and love your way!",
        "Answer": "To be clear – I encourage rational, healthy, critical thinking. It’s why I am confident in what I am providing because it can (and is) hard-tested in a scientific way. Many people here in the audience and community at JR Prudence are either in contact with our friends from above or are in the process of doing so. I receive many private messages about these – some of whom ask me to keep it confidential, so I do not post all the verified validations and corroborations – only enough and those who will allow me to post – to show that this is very real. It’s not just a guy typing science fiction articles. It’s interactive. Our friends from above will gladly contact anyone interested in doing so and I am simply here to bridge that gap to encourage others they can. Several of our friends from above have already visited many of those connected here, including your fiancée and yourself. They are showing themselves to you because part of this is also publication for real and verified contact. Please, do not apologize for “testing me” here because you are doing so in good faith and healthy critical thinking and observation – which is the real ‘scientific’ way of doing things.",

No one believes me and I should have kept my mouth shut about all this but because I apparently can't lie very easily or withhold information I've put myself in a situation where I don't know how to proceed. Anyway, not sure what to say or do",
        "Answer": "It's important that you act with prudence when it comes to sharing any of these matters. People already make up their minds, so trying to convince anyone is like trying to undo a choice that was already made. Sift the sands and test the waters for open-mindedness. If it's there, then only give a taste and never the whole thing. Don't try to convert anyone. The better thing to do is to not even mention this website or information and just act in love. That \"beacon\" will open their hearts, and they'll become curious. They'll want to become more like you. From there, if it's necessary to share, do so. If not, then just enjoy the love between you and your family.",

        "Question": "Hey Prudence. Hope your day is well, I wanted to ask this as a ground agent/contactee. From your past several posts, you've all made me well aware that you all are not looking for perfectionism or laying down our lives for the highest good. To be honest, I don't want to dedicate myself as hard as you but I am extremely appreciative of the efforts you've made for our universe. With all this being said, I wanna ask: What can I do as a ground agent that supports the highest good that doesn't forgo my earthly responsibilities? Something that goes beyond being nice and spreading love? I've explored many facets of supporting the good fight but I think it would help me and the community as a whole if we had some particular roles we can play in our local communities that would support positive disclosure and build positive environments for us and the uninitiated.",
        "Answer": "That was very well said already and thank you for the message. Indeed, the roles are so diverse that we have to use our imagination. Our friends from above aren’t asking anyone to give any more or less than what they are willing to do and can conceive. In that respect, for some ground agents/contactees, it may be to work in a “local environment.” Perhaps at one’s local job, park, neighborhood, community, family, friends etc., which can create a positive-feedback-loop to create higher soul field critical mass. For others, perhaps it can be to uplift the comments section here, or the forums – or support/donate to this cause – or another altogether that’s doing the right thing; some of which, do not even have to be directly related to UFOs/aliens; just that which is moral and ethical. You, yourself, know deep down what you must do. To find it, practice connecting to the realme through Void Meditation. The realme is much more than thoughts and even feelings. It is BEING-EXISTENCE. When you tap into it, the path becomes clear and you’ll “download” the necessary data/resources from the realme (transversing dimensions) to know what you must do, where, and how. We all have our parts to play. Some of us who operate in the shadows can do more good for those exposed to the limelight. NEVER underestimate your own path and what you must do and compare yourself to no one. You ARE the ONE and the HERO in your own story. You are “IT” and you have the power to do “it” the way you see fit/best.",

        "Question": "Hey thank you for the prompt response you already know im taking it all to heart. Vic (the mod of this subreddit) decided to create this community to bring together as many starseeds as possible to push towards \"heaven on Earth\" or 5D ascension. And she is tasked to do this under the Student Collective of Thoth. I have not contacted this collective (if i have then i am completely unaware of who they are and how they operate) but I recalled that you're in communication with Thoth, so I was wondering what you thought of her. Im sorry i mean to use the pronoun 'They'. But they seem to be posting a lot of support for multitudes of starseeds from all over with a focus on bringing forward lecture material from Thoth and 'Pay-as-you-like' readings to help awaken the uninitiated. Personally, with myself having learned to remotely empathize with others, i can feel the willpower they have to bring Thoth's messages as far as they can and it is powerful. More than solely being a figurehead, they want to create space for starseeds to express themselves unadulterated from the moderations of r/starseeds. And it feels bad to see their words come to a small audience of, at the time of this text, 431 members, each post barely reaching any engagement. I can see their efforts and your efforts akin to one another (in that you both felt like these channelings deserve to be imparted to as many people as possible). So I was wondering if you could do research for yourself as well to see if it would be wise to spread their words to this website through a shoutout or any way you think it would be best.",
        "Answer": "This is a very good initiative, and I support it. As usual, however, I cannot vouch for the longevity of things. It’s possible things can start good and end up bad – that’s up to the long-term performance of contactees, ground agents, etc., that must “keep up the maintenance work” through sound mind, body, and “soul.”",

During one of my recent Ketamine Assisted Therapy sessions, it came through loud and clear that \"you are able to heal yourself\" In Part VI there is much discussion of healing oneself as a prerequisite to contact. So I have a nerve pain problem in my low back that Dr's. Haven't been able to really deal with other than injections, which don't last. Now they're talking about using a laser to literally \"fry\" the nerves which might help for a year or 2. So my question: I believe I can heal this...but I'm at a loss to know how exactly. Might you or our friends offer any suggestions? I've been using some guided meditation to reach the Void. Still working on it. You've and our Friends have pried the lid off my noggin in the past month. I am terribly grateful and humbled my the knowledge. And it's much more stimulating than lawn bowling",
        "Answer": "It’s important that I firstly make it clear that I am not anti-medicine, anti-doctor, anti-institution etc., nor am I ultra-holistic and so forth. If a person feels deep down that they need to go to the doctor, then you should go – same applies with taking medication. What I’ll say is that it takes time for things to manifest and that includes health. Yes, you can greatly speed up your healing and recovery through zero-doubt-powered-will-focused intentions to heal and get better. Many people around the world have already done this and surprised medical professionals. You must focus/set your intention on healing with zero doubt and KNOW it can be done.",

        "Question": "1. Assuming that most of us here are contact persons: have we already reached a higher level of evolution and reincarnated here for a mission? Or, however, are we still part of humanity and, like everyone else, are here to simply learn the lessons of love?",
        "Answer": "Most contactees/starseeds/ground agents are on a “higher fractal dimension in soul-spirit-mind/consciousness-matrix” and thus, can be considered, in a sense, more likely evolved – though even between them, there are varying levels depending on interest and purpose. That doesn’t mean they’ll keep up, though. It’s like starting a race and gassing out halfway. You have to train/have the conditioning to “keep up” over time and not get “worn out” or sellout etc. Most ground agents aren’t here to be part of humanity. They’re here for very specific mission purposes that are usually in relation to ET interests. Some “starseeds” that reincarnate from say dying on earth in previous ET lifetimes are mistakenly here. Others that are implanted by choice may indeed want to “experience the dream” of walking among humanity. There are various reasons for why contactees, starseeds, and ground agents exist. The general rule of thumb is that ground agents tend to be a lot more mission focused than the others since they’re not really here “on holiday” so to speak, whereas some starseeds willing incarnate to experience humanity.",

Why, then, do ETs treat us as \"Earth humans,\" and why the distinction between different ET \"races\" at all, if we are part of one consciousness at another density level?",
        "Answer": "ETs do not view it that way. “Humans” of earth (in their physical vessels) view it that way. The translations of telepathic contact can sometimes come across this way because “a bridge has to be built relative to current understanding.” ETs, particularly the ones I am in contact with, who are the “zookeepers” – do not see life/beings so different as “earth humans” do. They already know what’s going on in reality. We are all part of one consciousness/one/IT in different densities and dimensions – and ETs, especially Damien, Mantis, E, C, L, and their collective groups (along with others) – know VERY well, which is why they are so careful with contact and how/when/where to go about doing it.

Some of the videos were quite gruesome and It made me sad thinking about them being here so far from home, and what I presume to be effectively a prisoner here… that and their dead/ dying friends in the other videos. My other question is if Bob is connected to the 3-3-3 Collective/ Damien or if they are from a separate group/ type of Grey alien?",
        "Answer": "I asked Damien to comment on this. This is what he said: “The realme behind Skinny Bob has reconstituted into a new avatar. He’s fine. Skinny Bob is connected [to us] and operates within our collective.”",

        "Question": "Also… after reading today’s, where you spoke with Damien about these “leaders”/ narcissists and their actions/ motives, and how they operate. I haven’t spoken in this forum about my experiences with being targeted, but from what you’ve described there and in earlier posts, you’ve put my experience into words in a way I would not have been able to, and it made me feel better reading it. Without going into too much detail on my experiences (cause just the last year alone could probably be a novel in its own) but the TL;DR is Im an ... student, and I have been pushed away from art my whole life (year after in grade school up to high school), it always didn’t feel fair, but I believed what I was told and I “fell in line” so to speak to make everyone else happy, so I abandoned ... in high school, went to college, etc. but the urge overwhelmed after a few years and, after a period of lost time/ mental breakdown of sorts (not sure how to describe it) just before COVID, and coming out of it I realized art is what I needed to do, covid prevented me from going to school right away, so I worked and stuff until beginning of last year I finally attended college for art! (Illustration) since then, immediately, I have encountered the same pushback I had felt my entire life, except tenfold, it seemed like I was really no welcome there by most of peers, and the faculty, but especially the person running the program… they employed all the tricks you mentioned, trying to make me feel like I’m too old (I’m ... btw) that I have no business being here, I’m not a real artists, that I’m taking something away from the people that have nothing else besides ..., etc etc, but I was hard working and never gave up, and that’s when the darker tactics started, hacking my personal devices (which I have proof for, the school still hasn’t acknowledged that), spreading rumors about me (I’d walk into a life drawing session and people would go quiet and look at me whisper stuff like how I’m a criminal, and how I did X Y and Z deplorable things I won’t repeat), including sexual, verbal harassment, nearing to physical (in terms of slamming fists and screaming and throwing things/ breaking objects to try to get me to snap). This went on for a year, I had people in my life that said “ignore them ignore them”. I did report them to literally everyone I could, the ombudsman, the chair, the students association, security, IT services, etc, and nobody is doing anything. I even went to the police about it, and they took it very seriously (I have proof of the hacking attempts, they were too stupid to do that off of school networks, and I got the logs) but then police told me to “not make up false accusations about people” low and behold, the head of security who I spoke with is former police and made a point of saying she friends with person I accused of sexually harassing me and hacking me (this person was my ... btw). Despite all this… I’m still treated like I’m the problem for bringing this stuff to light… teachers act like I’m make the school blow up if I keep talking about it, and a good chunk of my classmates (who are very vocally friends with this teacher I reported) have not stopped the harassment and bullying and stalking, which gets ignored ofc. The only reason I didn’t get a lawyer or go to the press (which I was about to do 4 weeks ago) is because I got what I belive was a message, like it was zapped right into my head as I was pulling up lawyers phone numbers “you will destroy your enemies without lifting a finger”. I know they won’t stop, and I know there will never be justice from an authority, not the school or police certainly, but I also know the thing they want most is me to give up and abandon art, like I’ve been pressured to do my whole life. This has only strengthened my resolve and they feel it I believe, hence the increase in frequency and desperation of their tactics. At any rate, I feel I have a handle on that situation, it literally involves me just focusing on my art, and building my frequencies/love/light, and they will fade as you say… but I did have a question to you regarding physical contact. I’ve noticed since I had that dream a few weeks ago with the writing on the wall on the entity that wanted it from me, it’s had an effect on my day-to-day life… random people keep trying to touch me, some have followed me after class, or are not-so-covertly waiting for me where I usually eat lunch. Many of the regular harassers have avoided me entirely, but the ones who haven’t have crancked it up to 11, and are making it a point of trying to bump into me, knock the back of head when I’m seating with their bag, poke and other things… this was not the case up to this point, sure they’d get too close and flail their arms but they would never actually touch me, but it feels like “the gloves are off” now and they really want to. Sorry, forgot actually ask the question, my question is there any merit to the concept of not letting strangers or those you know have ill will touch you? Or get to close? And I don’t just mean in the creepy sense, but just touching in general, like poking or nudging for attention. I’ve seen this advice in a few places regarding contactées and my best friend (who is a contactée but wants nothing to do with it) has stated to me “don’t let anyone touch you” unprovoked about 2 weeks ago which I thought was very interesting timing, especially because he brought it up out of the blue.",
        "Answer": "First of all, I’m very sorry you had to endure those experiences. Nevertheless, you are very strong and capable. Abusers can really turn the tables on people and even convince others that their abuse is justified or that the abuse is not happening at all. Still, you got this, and you should continue on your path of self-empowerment. Abusers feed into a sick feedback loop. They get a certain “high” off the fear, paranoia, mistrust, guilt, shame, reprimand and toxicity they instill into others. The key is of course not to feed into it. Take a stand where needed but do not feed into them. Like trolls, they will eventually lose steam. Also, you are so young. Barely in your mid-twenties. The idea of you being old is utterly false. Your contactee friend is correct, by the way. You shouldn’t let these people touch you – although I should state clearly that you shouldn’t be afraid if they do. The key takeaway is do not be afraid of them and they have no power over you.",

As implied by Garry Nolan I thought it was mass consciousness imposition like something which imprinted in your mind while it was not really there. Is this true?",
        "Answer": "Representations do not need to be 100% absolutely perfect for a gateway for telepathy and eventually, physical contact to happen. For example, think about the law of attraction or other similar practices. You focus on an idea, image, visualization etc., to bring forth that thing – whatever it is, including if it’s a person (e.g., thinking about your soulmate who may have red hair and when she/he manifests in person, they do have red hair but maybe it’s a little lighter than your imagination). I’ve been directed by our friends from above to use certain imagery of their representations because they are very real and often dismissed as fiction. The “mass consciousness imposition” does not take away from the truth, regardless of how many people think up similar ideas. People are thinking similar ideas despite creative liberties and some differences because these entities/beings are very real.",

In both instances when the guide speaks about your heart, I begin to get....a tight feeling there. I have had to stop and can't continue as it's too distracting.

        "Answer": "It’s due to the emotional baggage and other issues that must be resolved. Void meditation never immediately works. As I said in another Q/A session, Void Meditation “brings up” what exists in the psyche to “clean it out” instead of sweeping it under the carpet. It provides clarity. After this has been done for some time, it becomes easier to slip into the nothingness. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither will the full potency of true meditation become available so easily.",

        "Answer": "With the explanations in Disclosure with Damien, the Extraterrestrial Tall Grey Alien contacting JR Prudence – you can begin to see that reincarnation isn’t exactly accurate and pure linearity doesn’t truly exist since the spirit, interconnected to the soul field, pulls upon data in multiple directions. If it pulls data in multiple directions, then it pulls multiple bits of data as spatial bits and anything that is spatial is temporal as spacetime. Linear reincarnation dictates X amount of years as a strict, fixed absolute when the reality is mutable and dependent on the environmental conditions, realme evolutionary level, spacetime dimension, and many more factors. So, to a certain degree, there does exist some time that the spirit has to continue growing up and using multiple avatars to do so. However, it is not absolutely fixed as 75k years for ALL GRAND SPACE AND TIME across the multi-cosmos because that is not how spacetime works. A hundred years passing here can be up to 1,000 in another dimension, or even 1 minute – making that idea of a fixed, absolute number incredibly wrong. The natural way of evolution/structure is simply put like this: our spirits, in initial form have a form of psychic-conscious knowledge as to what it is and what it must do. Naturally, in a developing world, it will “choose” to reassemble; hence the misinterpretation with reincarnation. The “spirit” is not bound by strict absolute time measures because such notions do not exist in the relativity of spacetime. That’s your tell-tale sign something is VERY off about the information.",

        "Question": "Are your contacts aware of the Ra Collective? If so, what is their opinion of Ra? Do they consider them allies or part of the manipulation? If Ra is misleading people, what is their agenda?",
        "Answer": "As said in today’s message, it’s not my job to be calling out anyone. I, personally, do not care to provide such information – hence my lack of care to investigate. However, since the OP’s initial time, my contacts have informed me that the Law of One books are misleading dogma. Once again, they are teachings – and they even speak about the Orion group very negatively when the Orion group is benevolent. Naturally, as is the case with propaganda and false information, they use half-truths to then employ their narratives and twists. That is why my contacts; namely, my grey contacts/Damien’s group, has made it abundantly clear that all teachings should be disregarded. As said here previously in one of the earlier transcriptions with Damien –\nP: This leads me to another part here to bring up – I’ve heard about this Law of One book or teachings and I am not sure of it. I haven’t read it, but others have brought it up to me and I previously said “it was on the right track” – but there were warnings in some of these teachings that the “group from Orion is evil” or something along those lines…\nD: Of course, they’d say that. Again, this is exactly what we are referring to which is why we have said time and time again – the age of teachings are over. Mystics can no longer be trusted to fully get our message out without their egos getting in the way. Once more, this does not apply to every single person and there do exist some good mystics whom we love and enjoy very much. However, for the vast majority, especially the (wannabe)-mystics from Europe and America who hear of the Indian way of life and suddenly believe they can replicate it better – these are the (jokers) that do not understand what they meddle with and only contribute damage toward the “spiritual truth” which is not “spiritual” nor “material” but simply TRUTH – AS IT IS.",

        "Question": "Are the density system described by Ra accurate? Whereas there are 7 major densities (not to be confused with the word \"dimension\"), with each density having 7-sub densities that spiral upwards towards the infinite creator or (GCS in your terms), and the octave (8th density) is reintegration within the source/gcs/infinite creator. If so, is humanity shifting from the 3rd Density into the 4th as we speak?",
        "Answer": "Anything relating to a strict 7 should be very carefully looked at for deception. 7 is notoriously known as the mystic’s “spiritual number” when the reality is that 8 and 9 are higher as Pythagoras already pointed out – who, ironically, was mystical himself. Additionally, nothing exists in a strict, rigorous 7-format and, as usual, these mystical teachings love to utilize the number 7 as is the case with standard theosophy and other cults; occults, teachings, and doctrines that speak on similar lines. REAL ETs deal with numbers WAY, WAY, WAY above anything we can imagine. That is why the idea of the 8-point-infinity convergence is so important – not because of 8 as a value of eight ones, but as an INFINITY loop in ALL directions. There are COUNTLESS higher and lower dimensions and the notion they end at 7, or are in strict steps of seven, is incredibly false and a direct sign of mystical manipulation usually hinging on New Age concepts taken from former theological doctrines.",

        "Answer": "Answered here previously:\nP: Can you speak a little more on Orion as I had others ask me about it.\nD: It’s one of our stations. We have many worlds, including the famous Zeta Reticuli, which is not our “home” but one of many worlds with our stations and technology. Our home belongs to another dimension/universe/time.\nP: Ah, now it’s starting to make sense the instigators and false prophets would cite the Orion 3-3-3 group as evil – to stir confusion among contactees and the genuinely interested by using half-truths?\nD: Naturally.",

See if there’s openness to higher ideas and truths. Implant (small seeds) of truth – feel it out and see what happens.

        "Answer": "This was previously answered here: As our friends from above have said, they use pretty much anyone. Greer has been used by ETs, even up to this day – for disclosure. However, as I mentioned with other contactees, it doesn’t mean that because they receive some assistance means that they know everything or that their egos are quelled. Greer is a bit in the middle. He’s being used by multiple sides (including CIA), but he also thinks quite highly of himself – namely as a self-defense protective mechanism from all the flak he’s experienced over the years.

        "Question": "3.2 Bob was in fear of his soul being permanently damaged as he was fighting one such entity while OOB. Is this something that can happen to spirit singularities in general? I know you mentioned we're immortal, but does that simply imply we do not have an \"age limit\", and that our spirits otherwise can still be destroyed via other means?",
        "Answer": "The spirit/realme cannot be fully destroyed but it can be “brought back down” to a base level. This is extremely rare, however. Usually only done by very, very, very advanced NHI/ETs at Ascended Prime and beyond. They can clean out/clear out “evolution” via knowledge and “reset” (spirits) to a base-level. There are “vampiric” forces that can leech soul force/energy, including the INHI invaders – but not to the extent of fully destroying a spirit because such is impossible. They can only feed like ticks on an animal. They need the “animal” to stay alive.",

Is it a visualization of the realme itself, or just an imagination of the realme / image of realme about itself? After all, it is intimately tethered to the physical body still. Was Bob able to / close to being able to come back to his realme during his OOB experiences?",
        "Answer": "OOB = utilization of the soul field to project one’s consciousness. The realme singularity is not the OOB. It doesn’t look “human.” The realme is in another realm/adjacent dimension whereas OOBs, while also in another dimension, aren’t in the same dimension as the realme.

Specifically for Damien's group, the following applies:\nAdequate mental, physical, and emotional health and wellbeing.\nProper rest, relaxation, and sleep.\nProper diet and nutrition.\nExtended daily (usually hours of) meditation practices - on specific days, remote viewing and other psionic abilities.\nTrained and continued psionic countermeasures and defenses, including psychic sensing and nullification.\nGenuine intent - intellectual integrity, objectively proper moral and ethical upstanding (especially when \"no one is looking.\")\nAbility to keep confidentiality when necessary and do not blabber.\nKnowledge in psychology, sociology, and awareness of infiltration operations and intelligence.\nKnowledge in physics, mathematics, media, art, programming, internet technology, astronomy, logic, epistemology, and counter-knowledge concerning the occult, theology, theosophy, and religion, along with history, and philosophy.\nAbility to read and write to a relatively high degree to impart proper understanding of telepathic transmissions.\nVersatile consciousness; universality of the mind and its thinking.\nNon-conformance to any predominant culture, belief, religion, spirituality, thinking, bias, politics, ideology, or personal whims.\nPure intention for genuine truth, uprightness, decency, humaneness without personal desires getting in the way.\nInability to be compromised by having relative life satisfaction and contentment; no predominant needs (beyond the necessities to survive and operate) that can make a person prone to \"selling out.\"\nBeing open to other ideas, cultures, beliefs, words, terminologies, systems etc. outside one's upbringing, influences, environments, educations, and culture.\nEmbracing ontological shocks and not resisting them.\nOpenness to be taught; humility.\nOpenness to receive; telepathy.\nStrength of one's character and trust in one's capabilities.\nRelatively high development of oneself to the utmost degree (this usually takes decades.)\nCourage, bravery, wisdom, prudence, patience, self-discipline, self-autonomy.\nStrong sense of discernment between good and evil, knowing right from wrong.\nIt's like being prepared for a job. Your container/vessel has to be \"up\" to it as much as your mind and consciousness.

        "Answer": "Sleep is a form of “attuning to the other side” or the soul field through unconscious processing. It’s necessary to the extent that one can reconnect to a certain degree and move between the soul field (including unconscious astral projection). Without a physical body, there’s no sleep in the same sense, but there is also a “re-attunement” to higher levels of being/soul fields. Since everything is relative, this is why some grey avatars, for example, can hibernate for minutes after weeks and months of no sleep and gain the benefits of an (earth human container) sleeping for 8 to 10 hours.",

        "Answer": "Will as in spirit-will, is a force that doesn’t use thoughts. It’s a pure psychic-energetic drive. It’s a direction. One can (direct/drive) themselves to (letting go.)

        "Answer": "Before engaging in telepathy, use void meditation (let go; nothingness) to (restore the physicality) to its prime. Then, one can be clear-minded and self-autonomous enough that they can engage in telepathy without being fooled by yourself or external forces. Void meditation is nothing. No thoughts – even if feelings, aspirations and ideas arise. The more one engages in this, the more there’s nothing but a (pure energy bliss-feeling). Telepathy uses thoughts, feelings, images, symbols, and practically anything in the consciousness – including education from media, books, teachings; and the whole nine yards.",

No. Smoking an entire box of cigarettes? No. Being stoned out of your mind every day on weed? No. Taking mushrooms every day or every week?

        "Question": "Since the soul cannot be destroyed, how do battles or wars take place on a spiritual level, and how does that influence the outcome of a war?",
        "Answer": "An excellent question. There are many forces, namely, interdimensional forces, who are well aware of how these processes work. Our consciousness is multidimensional. When we extend its reach through temporal views, we extend parts of our souls (not realme), but since the soul is interconnected to the realme (as a singularity) – then it can feed data back to the realme, which in turn, feeds data back to the (current present) consciousness. Remember the 8-point-infinity convergence and 3-point-pincer. This applies for ALL SPACETIME. Consciousness, mind, body, spirit, soul, physical, non-physical – everything and anything = the fabric of spacetime. If it’s in the fabric of spacetime, even nulltime, then it bears spatial and temporal properties that can transverse information. Thus, if a temporal view is connected to another dimension, it can stream data back into one’s current spacetime position/present – which is why the “great temporal war” was so dangerous. Many people connected to it went insane or died. Some ETs and interdimensional NHI were also wiped out from existence. There will be more information on this in the future.",

But the simulation tweak 'failed' (watch in awe and wonder of the beauty of even the failures.) And personal grudges turned to tribal, and national, and headed to be interplanetary (I know you said Musk wants to control the world, but listening to him talk, it's beyond one planet for him, if you watch the patterns. Just like people throw him in as the 'real' president of the US, his aims are higher, his demeanor to not only adjust US policy but to be pushing at Europe and other nations as well.) Musk and other would be leaders like him won't be allowed I think to get to interplanetary, but that's the goal, and may be at least a spec of the reason we're on the cusp of another 'tweak'.",
        "Answer": "Partly, yes, but it’s also a degeneration of the genes. Shorter lifespans do amount to greater control from forgetfulness. As much as I’d love to blame our simulation overloads, it’s also the simulated bringing forth their reality as well.",

You said lots of it is stored in the subconcious, but mirroring source, a 'singular' realme may inhabit multiple vessels. You and I and the whole board perhaps share the same realme in this theory. (though I'm not suggesting that is the case.) There's the further complexity that distinguishing one out of one is silly, since source is all, but the easiest way to work in this realm is partitions, like dissections and cross sections in science to evaluate a piece of the whole. (macro-micro fractal zoom) is this in line with the nuances you've spoke about?",
        "Answer": "The soul field is interconnected throughout all (see the recent diagrams) like, for the sake of example, planetary nebula whereas the (realmes) would be the planets/suns. Just as how these newly formed planets/suns were unable to be formed without the collective planetary nebula, the same applies for the realmes.

I do feel I've been more accepting of my \"feminine\" energy than most other hetero men I've met personally, so maybe my inner 'balancing scale' isn't steady causing the emotional exhaust.

One’s “soulmate” can even be themselves (if necessary) – so focus on what your inner being calls you toward. That’s the point. However, if you are “afraid of being alone” so you stay being alone, then that’s less of “being alone by self-acceptance.” If you are to be alone, it shouldn’t be a response because of fear of potential disappointment.

        ],
        "Question": "In the last few transcripts their have been multiple mentions of Damian being \"out of time\" or \"to busy to stay\". It got me thinking about how time is perceived and experienced by different entities. How can one be \"out of time\" if you can turn back the clock or see into the future to better prepare. Is theirs a \"master\" timeline that exists outside our simulations time effects or does is work another way?",
        "Answer": "Time still moves no matter where your (current present/position is) with the exception of Nullspace/hyperspace layers that are subspaces between spaces and can act as “pass through points” between local spacetime dimensions. It’s a matter of the rate of the local spacetime’s movement that is relative to its position, gravitational distortion (spacetime warpage, such as the case with black holes – but any planetary body, spacetime curving, etc., can create warpage), radiation properties, and other spatial anomalies. Expanding upon this, if two of us were to travel to a medium or supermassive black hole, and I were to remain in the ship while you jumped into it – then I’d be looking at you fall into the black hole, get redshifted, and stay there (from my position/present) for practically forever – almost “stuck” to the black hole as light-bending illusion from gravitational-temporal distortion. From your perspective, however, you’ll experience (all the information) that falls into that black hole (from the past, present, and future) which may appear as if the universe passes by before you as you (from your present) fall into it. To keep this simple without going into exhaustive explanations of pincers, the future and the past aren’t in the same position as the present. For example, five minutes ago, the earth was not in the same position as it is now around the sun. The same applies to five minutes into the future as opposed to five million years – where the orbit begins to decline/change. Time is relative to position, so where the space is, is where the time is – and how the space curves, changes the rate of the time’s speed. Depending on the dimension, energy/matter compression, spatial geometric curvature, gravitational distortions (spacetime warpage), mass, and energy, the rate of time can be slower, faster, or – in the case with much higher dimensions (in terms of energetic compression) – nearly standstill and appear, from our perspective, “timeless” – hence the religious and occult confusion about ethereal realms being “without time.” While Damien and other ETs can transverse between dimensions, they cannot stop the flow of time as a state of general nature (in non-hyperspce/Nullspace dimensions) because time is congruent to spatial existence existing as a distinguished form (in dimensions with boundaries, ends, and curvatures whereas hyperspaces do not contain these distinctions). I’ve used the example previously with a table. Let’s say you buy a table from home depot. It’s in parts in the box. It cannot be immediately considered a table as a form of individuum existence as, well, a ‘table.’ It takes (time) to build the table so that you can then identify those former pieces as one object that you consider one individual table. Same applies to your physical avatar/body, that requires a sum of components such as the genetics from your ancestors and their entire family history before you were born and can exist as you. So, as you can see from these examples, namely with the table being spatial existence; what is considered “space” as a “spatial event” and “spatial existence” is dependent on temporal flow. Temporal flow never stops, even if, say, it passes differently based on the position/dimension of spacetime with the exception of hyperspace null layers that act as “pass through” points. Hyperspace isn’t a place for any being to exist in, save for beings that are above AP and exist in these realms. They are extremely advanced and have nothing to do with interdimensional invaders because they are way past that point. Damien and his crew can travel past hyperspace layers through “wormholes” and can be in another “pocket” of spacetime that from our position and thus, perspective, exists in the “future” or the “past.” Additionally, the spacetime warpage, energetic compression, mass, curvature, spatial geometric properties etc., can be different from ours here – making the RATE/flow of time/temporal data/keyframes either slower or faster. Since Damien and his crew are well aware of these processes much better than us, they utilize it to full extent to transverse many times, spaces, dimensions etc., in as (little relative time) as possible. They can enter another dimension, spacetime, position of grand space etc., be there for five hours while, from our perspective, only five minutes has passed – or perhaps, five hundred years have passed. Damien is constantly pressed for time because he utilizes as much of it as he can. He constantly travels between different dimensions doing (classified work) that alters many different pockets of space and time which affects not only this spacetime region, but many others. When he says he is “out of time” it means he’s extremely busy because he’s quite frankly a workaholic and makes the most out of the consciousness and technology offered to him and his collective that can transverse spacetime in multiple directions. What more should be known regarding hyperspace or Nullspace layers is that they are stretched in infinite directions. If the space is stretched infinitely with no geometric curvature, boundary, “end” etc., as the case with 3D dimensions including universal geometry, then there can be no measurable distance. If there’s no measurable distance, there can be no temporal flow in its traditional causal state. The space becomes spacelessness and thus if it is spaceless from being stretched infinitely, time cannot find a specific point to exist in as a flow – and therefore becomes timeless. That is how one can pass through hyperspace via wormholes and appear in another realm/area/position of space/universe/dimension etc., in less than a fraction of a second.",

        "Question": "How are they able to operate outside of our pocket and effect the past with creating paradoxical outcomes?",
        "Answer": "There aren’t as many paradoxical outcomes as one may assume. Usually, since few people really hunt/search for “timeline” changes, especially past changes, they can be very subtle contrary to fictional movies of dramatic changes. Because space is always moving, time is always moving (even if ET/NHI didn’t interrupt/alter any processes). That means these processes are always at work without any artificial intervention because of the 3-point pincer and 8-point infinity convergences carrying quantum data in the past, present, and future simultaneously and endlessly (doesn’t switch off). Contrary to our belief of strict absolute fixed events of the past, reality doesn’t work this way. Subtle changes in other pockets/regions of spacetimes can affect/alter other spacetimes or “timelines” – even faintly without our conscious awareness. That is how we are able to discover, and increasingly so, more events that happened in the past that we had no clue of before (in astronomy, geology, paleontology etc.) in the here and now and the then to come while back in the then (and in the now), we assume(d) we already found either all the discoveries or a significant portion that requires no further search. Mandela effects are part of these processes too. It can be very easy to change events when data becomes displaced and in very subtle ways that adds up over time to dramatic changes. You can see this with orbital mechanics. When a celestial body changes its orbit by barely seconds, which may not seem like much in the now, but as time goes on, it adds up to millions of years of difference that eventually completely disrupts the orbit and even shoots a celestial body out of its previous orbital parameters. Another example – you may have information in your consciousness now regarding an event that happened in your life. When your physical body dies, that knowledge goes with you unless it is recorded somewhere. If it’s recorded somewhere, let’s say in a physical book or digital archive, then it is still prone to eventual change such as when the inevitability happens that the earth gets swallowed by a black hole and that information falls inside. By that (present) in the (future), the information regarding the details of the event of your past life (as your present one here and now) will be changed and altered to accommodate the black hole’s singularity/spacetime warpage. High technology can of course extract data and change it/format it in such a way to bring relative understanding that the data can be comprehended and not an encoded black hole quantum signature. The mutability of reality comes from the expansion and contraction of space as does its temporal flow in all directions at once (3/8-point pincers). Information is constantly changing and never standstill because it is constantly going through different realms to stabilize the existence of those realms – be it that those realms are five minutes ago, five million years ago, now as you read this message, then three minutes in the future, a billion years in the future etc. – and if it is a different time, then it’s a different position, and if it’s a different position of space, then it’s a different region/dimension.",

        ],
        "Question": "1. Does causality always hold in the face of these abilities to traverse spacetime in the time dimension? I asked because there've been mention of cults being made \"irrelevant\" / timeline shifted to prevent adverse outcome in some past posts that you wrote. IIRC you have also mentioned that causality does not necessarily need to hold beyond local (3-point pincer?) spacetime?",
        "Answer": "Causality is only our local perspective to make sense of the data flowing in all directions, but much of causality is perception. The present doesn’t have “causality.” It’s a standstill of anywhere between nano-micro seconds to 3 seconds to hours, depending on what you’re doing. You can only identify causality from a future and past event happening which is why some people can get “lost in time” or “lost in their present” based on their awareness/consciousness and perception/action/event – say getting lost in a meditation, painting, gaming, movie, work, etc. Despite, let’s say, if you recorded history of an event that happened and let’s say that chronological data becomes lost, then how can you prove the event happened? Okay, let’s say it’s in your consciousness and your physical avatar dies. How can you say that that event really happened? This is how Atlantis and Mu got wiped out and now it’s mysterious because there’s no mainstream recorded historical archives, so it’s deemed fiction. That’s how it works. When information is lost or changed, it alters perception. Since perception is hooked to consciousness and consciousness still has electromagnetic and quantum signals – both being spatial events/spatial existences, it contains temporal data. And as Damien mentioned, every speck, every distance, every micro and macro position contains 3/8-point pincers transversing data and information. Of course, all data is “saved” on the “other side” so it is only relatively alterable to the extent of changing the data. If something is “wiped out” then it is really “changed” into a form that, from a surface perspective, seems completely different. An example would be the transitory nature between a planet into a gas giant into a brown dwarf into a sun. All stages, the celestial body appears to look very different, yet it is only because of the changes in information, events (e.g., asteroid impacts, planetary collisions etc.), forming of greater mass etc.",

        "Answer": "Yes, and both. Mantis clarified this in this post here: A \"Message From Above\" (Part VII) & The Interdimensional Invaders – namely this part – M: I shall cover it from here. What must be KNOWN to your audience concerning the nature of REALITY as we have expressed many times over is that one is only a FRACTAL EXPRESSION of the ALL-SPARK. The ALL-SPARK as the true oneness penetrates in all dimensions. While this is true from a naturally occurring point of view, the reality is that we can (manipulate; engineer; change; alter) dimensions of all kinds. To understand this, we must explain what a dimension really is. Many of you may be exposed to science fiction, so you deem a dimension as an entire universe or plane. In truth, all dimensions are connected from the micro to the macro. If, say, a micro dimension is alterable, copyable, and changeable, then so is the case for larger dimensional types. Yes, we use technology to assist this process. That is why/how your current earth, as say, earth 0.030183501 is one dimensional space of the totality of all crisscrossing dimensions. As we had Prudence draw the images of the 8-point-pincer infinity loops and how spatial and temporal fabrics operate in unison, we must also add that this applies all-round throughout all spaces and times in every direction and every moment. Naturally, the ALLNESS is copying micro-pockets of this data and saving it. We possess the technology to (amplify the hyper quantum) into the (hyper macro) – meaning, we can create an alternative simulation/dimension of a room, a house, a city, a nation, a country, a planet, a solar system, a galaxy, and universe – and in fact, copy/split these into practically infinite dimensions of their own time-space relativity in adjacent realms.",

Mantis warns us about not believing everything we read because there are bad actors, people who misinterpret the truth etc. Theres so much content out there on NHI to read, how does one become closer to the truth without being skeptical? Sorry this post is mostly about me because I was a little disheartened when I read the part about skeptics. I feel as though they wont want to deal with me now. Ever since the start of this site ive been thinking that there's a possibility im a \"starseed\" (I hesitate to say anything like this because I have zero proof only a feeling/hope) and id like to contribute to the effort in some way. Ive been hoping for a sign to help me commit to this. What do your friends from above think? Even if im not a starseed or destined, I know in the end the chosen are the ones who choose.",
        "Answer": "There is a significant difference between critical thinking and coming to the truth through rational, clear-minded thinking, openness to possibilities, and true logic. Skepticism is tied to nihilism. While we can cite “healthy skepticism” as having some truth, the better approach would be “critical thinking” because skepticism is, by default, tied to nihilistic conceptualizations. It’s designed to disprove. Just as skeptics can criticize believer biases (seeing what they wish to see), the same applies to skeptics on the hunt to disprove everything. Real ETs do not have the time to deal with these kinds of people. Why would they? Picture for example, if I had a shoe that you can’t see, but you don’t believe that I don’t have the shoe – do I have to prove to you that the shoe exists when I know it exists and wear it to function in my daily life? Intellectual integrity and motive is important. Why are you seeking what you’re seeking? How can you be so sure that outside ideas, beliefs, and tenets – including those of aliens and their existence – must bend to your/my way of thinking? We may be prone to believe our way or the highway, yet it doesn’t work this way in reality. Skepticism is an appeal to authority, when epistemology disarms much of what we believe we know and brings into question what true knowledge is. When they say “they don’t deal with skeptics” they aren’t dealing with people who have a disprove-bias masking/dressing as “healthy skepticism” when they have a motive/intention to disprove.",

Several ancient artifacts, bases, and ET technologies still exist there to this day.",

        "Question": "Good day. On Feb 18 or 19, I had an experience, but somehow I'm a little bit doubting. I wanted to try DMT out of curiosity, but my friend only had LSD so I tried that. I sensed vibrations and spaces besides or within spaces. I messed around with it and found it was communication, and that the vibrations changes form when I observed it. Long story short, through will and surrender, dancing around these energies, I was able to catch the awareness behind the one that changes these vibrational forms whenever I observed them. In that moment without a doubt, I crashed the simulation. It was because I realized I was the Creator pretending to be me, and that somehow I figured this illusion out. Idk now but in that moment, I created new dimensions or forms of intelligence in order to randomize experiences again. I came out of it with a new perspective in life and commitment to create positive experiences. Also committed to bearing the Creators suffering. But now, it's hard. Because you realized that everyone else is just forms of you. And that each decision i make, someone suffers. Either I suffer or another person, who is just me essentially, suffers. It's a different kind of pain this is. Can your group confirm my experience? Was it just all in my mind? How do I deal with this paralysis? Thanks Prudence",
        "Answer": "You became one, more or less, with truth and bridged the gap between dimensions and the oneness principle. It was not all in your mind. To deal with it, know that you did discover higher truth – but you must now deal with the ontological shocks and the slow, methodical normalization of the knowledge in practical, grounded life. This process takes time.",

        "Question": "Thank you for your service and help with this community, it has been enlightening if nothing else. What is the true nature of logic? And what is logic’s relationship to the soul field?",
        "Answer": "This has to be one of the best questions asked to date. The true nature of logic comes from the word ‘logos’ which means “divine reason.” While of a mystical sounding sense, it bears truth to reality – as in, logic is reasoning conducted in accordance with validity through verity. It is the quality of being justifiable by reason which amounts to cause and purpose. Reason, however, is not strictly of an ideological nor dogmatic nature and can, in fact, exist outside books, scripture, and the accepted vernacular or rules. Logic matters greatly to finding truth because as the Greek word, logikós, already implied – it is pertaining to the soul; agreeable to reason or following reason. Rationality (true rationality) and true (spiritual) go hand in hand. True logic as in rationality are connected with the stability of one’s thought processes. Since the soul field is stimulated by consciousness, a truly logical consciousness can give enormous benefits to the feedback loop in the soul field that creates a rewarding critical mass.",
