    "Question": "Can you tell more about the different kinds of NHI? Like, do they look like something we would recognize? Like, do they look like something we would recognize? And if yes, what would the bad ones look like? So we know when we are in trouble or not. Are some also from this earth?",
    "Answer": "You are already familiar with the greys. There are tall ones and short ones. Most are benevolent. Most ET/NHI are humanoid. Some are also human-looking like us with their own culture, likes, dislikes, emotions etc. Just picture it like people from another country who are simply more ahead. They can make mistakes too. There are \"divine\" or \"higher beings\" beyond physicality, but these are rare and they do not interfere much unless they must alter the timeline to set things back on course for \"ultimate reintegration\" with the GCS. I've communicated with said beings only once or twice directly as sustaining telepathic communication with them is absurdly draining. As for the bad ones - some of them actually look human and there's a certain tracking with rep.... that I am now allowed to fully describe. What you need to know is that you do not need to be afraid of them because they are not anywhere near as powerful as \"the good ones.\" Some are from earth/living here, yes.",

    "Question": "Re. The ALL-Power; ALL-Singularity; Grand Central Cortex; the real 'God.'",
    "Answer": "Understanding this fully would require some basic grasp on quantum mechanics, spacetime, and how relativity works. Assuming you have some fundamental understanding, I will start with the basics—each of which, can be expanded into articles of their own.\n1 - There are multiple universes (I do not know the exact number), which would appear to be nearly infinite to our calculations. Each of them, like planets orbiting a central star or supermassive black hole such as SGR#A, are 'connected' to a 'grand central singularity.'\n2 - The GCS is in a 'hyperspace between hyperspaces'—it is quite literally at the CENTER OF ALL SPACES AND ALL TIMES IN ALL UNIVERSES ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS.\n3 - Each universe has multiple (infinite) dimensions, spaces, and times. Let that sink in. This means that each universe has its own 'central' singularity, and ALL these central singularities, similar to black holes, are all connected to the GRAND CENTRAL SINGULARITY.\n4 - Hyperspace is a space between traditional spacetimes where relativity applies.\n5 - Hyperspace is quantum in nature that is unlimited exponentially, which is precisely why distance as measurement does not exist. It's stretched infinitely in all directions and is quantum in nature; as in, it moves between its space instantly.\n6 - If space is stretched infinitely, then so is time because time is dependent on space and space, on time.\n7 - All spatial existence we can understand intuitively from causality. For example, if you buy a table from Home Depot, it is in parts - but the passage of time allows those parts to be assembled into a table that you can then say is a full table. Time allows space to exist, and space exists because of time.\n8 - A spaceless existence is therefore a timeless existence because if there's no distance for causality to flow, then space cannot exist in traditional relativity; information can simply float between this space without the relativity of time being a factor.\n9 - The GCS is sitting in a hyperspace layer in between ALL-hyperspaces in a quantum-entangled-null-space connected to all proceeding hyperspaces and traditional spacetime dimensions (such as classical reality), which is transmitting information to and fro.\n10 - The GCS is quite literally the “end point” singularity we are all going to and the beginning we started from, as it is just as much the present that is transmitting data from the past and future into the present.\n11 - The 'present' is singularity itself; an aspect of the GCS in tangible form.\nAdditional:\n1 - The GCS is interconnected throughout all spaces, times, and dimensions and EVERYTHING - not just living beings - but rocks, water, gasses, suns, computers, action figures, clothes; inanimate, seemingly 'dead things' - are ALL connected to it and ALL bear a fraction of it.\n2 - The GCS is everything and anything, so in this sense, I suppose you can see where mystics, philosophers and spiritualists develop ideas of 'universal love.'\n3 - The GCS is both the distant future and past as much as it is the present. You have to get used to this thinking to really understand it. Everything and everyone from a linear-causal perspective will \"become it\" just as much as they always were it. From what my contacts revealed to me, somehow, the GCS is empowering itself into higher and higher stages of further \"reincarnations.\" That is why existence exists and continues \"paying it forward.\" For a practical example, picture if I were to give you $20,000 to invest in your business. I'd expect you to give a ROI of let's say 150%. GCS is doing this.\nGCS is like an infinitely entangled ball of infinite strings interconnected throughout all spaces and times. Imagine a black hole - moreso a supermassive black hole - of which, a galaxy orbits around and is affected by its gravity. GCS has its \"spiral arms\" extended throughout all spaces and all times. We are all \"co-creators\" and \"the creator\" in different times and spaces.",

    "Question": "Can you talk more about this in the soul field and how we can access it via our own consciousness growth? I sense humans have large potential but we don't know how to access it or develop it properly.",
    "Answer": "I've consistently mentioned meditation but I did not get into much detail yesterday because I wanted my contacts to verify if I should continue. I've been given the OK, so I will share more. Meditation is not just about the obvious physical benefits such as better blood pressure, stable heart rate and breathing, along with the relaxation it provides. It's also about the aptitude of the pineal gland or as mystics call it 'third eye.' I've had difficulty processing this because I come from a background related to astrophysics, so at first, these concepts seemed completely otherworldly to me, but alas, they are all true. Meditation allows one to access their 'true self' which is the 'God-part' or the 'GCS-individuum-force' (aka \"spirit\") that bears no 'personality' in the traditional sense. Through meditation, one can become more familiar with the GCS-self or \"spirit\" and draw upon its power in the physical realm. Consciousness is awareness, so the higher the awareness, the more information/data the spirit has to work with. I can continue if need be, let me know.",

    "Tags": "Telepathic Contact",
    "Question": "Is there a differentiation between contact with nhi and what are sometimes known as spirit guides? Or put a different way- Is it obvious when you're connecting with an NHi?",
    "Answer": "For me, it is because I have already met them in person, seen their ships in person (up close) and remote viewed them. My telepathic abilities are at a level what you'd describe 'expert' (I spent 25 years developing it) and at this level, I can differentiate between who/what is contacting me. This is important because untrained telepathy can lead to contacting some not-so-good forces who can play upon your beliefs such as making you believe it is 'God' or some other force. It takes time, mental training, and supplying yourself with the necessary education. As a rule of thumb, the closer you are to your spirit, the less you can be deceived. Not only by NHI/higher forces, but by the matrix you live in and the humans trying to deceive you. Spirit guides, if you wish to call it that, are very rare. They mostly influence people unconsciously. These are beings who are beyond physical spacetime, which many NHI/ET, aren't. These beings are almost like the GCS \"protection squad.\" They keep things in order for the ultimate reintegration \"at the end of time.",

    "Answer": "Light, sound, and energy are - at a certain point in time - one. Certain frequencies can stimulate the vibrations of the mind/consciousness. Some are harmful. Others can attune or be closer to the \"spirit\" energy. As a rule of thumb, if it is more attuned to the spirit, it is more attuned to the GCS. The more attuned you are to the GCS, the more you can draw upon its power in all directions of past, present, and future. I highly recommend 852, 285, 396, and 639. There are others, but that should be sufficient to start with.",

What I can tell you is that analog computers can pull from the electromagnetic field and electromagnetic fields are affected by quantum mechanics. AI is also not 'evil' but no more or less a tool and an exposure to higher truth re. the nature that this is a simulation. Pay attention to the following:\nThe paradox of entanglement of photons over vast distances.\nThe paradox of static virtual fields (the fact that electrostatic and magnetostatic fields have an imaginary wave number).\nThe paradox of the missing negative mass/energy (the fact that we do not observe negative mass/energy yet are surrounded by it according to physical theory).\nThe paradox of instantaneous virtual field propagation (the experimental observation that changes in virtual electromagnetic field components propagate instantaneously).",

    "Answer": "Many, many, many, many, many things. To say at the least. I've gotten insights both from my reaching into my spirit, from NHI, from higher 'guides' amongst educating myself as much as possible in the education mankind has to offer. Some of the things I still do not understand or wrapping my head around are:\n- Sentient life can develop to the point that it can eventually create universes, not just seed life on other worlds.- Technically, all universes, even the naturally-developed ones, are simulated. This goes all the way back to the GCS. My guess is a \"paying it forward\" for the GCS to rise into higher states of being/energy. But how far does this go? Is there an end? What's the true end goal? Is it eternal and never-ending? Your guess is as good as mine.- Consciousness and spirit are somehow \"one\" in the GCS and increasingly so in higher wavelengths. What?- Consciousness has its own \"spacetime\" relativity. A mind can somehow connect its consciousness in the future (or past) and draw upon information/telepathy there. In other words, it's possible to communicate with beings (including regular people) in both past and future that's in YOUR present. Try to wrap your head around that one.- Among others.",

Listen to your 'true self' which does not have a personality, nor thoughts, in the traditional sense, but is a psychic-feeling-spirit-energy-force in a parallel dimension. Recommending you specific books is unwise at this time as receiving information before the connection to the spirit is dangerous.",

    "Answer": "Hopefully, my replies above will help you already. You are going to go to a \"higher\" place but you'll also re-exist in another. The best and easiest way to describe this is that you intermingle with the ALL-SPIRIT or the GCS and \"pass\" between it into different times and spaces.

When new life is born, a drop is taken out, which is a combination of particles from previous drops. So fractions of your old soul could be mixed with fractions of others to create a new consciousness. What do you think of this?",
    "Answer": "This is very good already. The GCS is like \"the ultimate consciousness\" of all time and space that is also \"the existence-enabling force.\" So, we both return to the ocean and come back from it in different times and spaces as all spirits/souls/ are intermixed throughout time.",

Not to say you are linear or underdeveloped, but let's face it, we grow up in a world that teaches us to think linearly. Our soul energy is only different in the sense of the relativity of time. Technically, all soul energy is connected all the way back to the GCS. So, a pollution of soul energy in one sector can have ripple effects in another. That is why the situation on earth is such a problem. Some ETs aren't aware of this, neither humans, and ignorantly and stupidly feed off corrupt soul energy. This is a big problem.",

It's recommended that the first step before 'contacting' anyone or anything (you can do this with regular people too, granted, their lower self - as in the physical self - may not immediately register these signals or \"understand it\" due to lacking information etc.) - you should focus on meditating on and connecting with your true self. You can do this through what I'd call Void or Nothingness meditation - which is basically letting all thoughts pass through you and do not grip to any of it. Your true \"self\" as in the higher self or true spirit has no personality, nor thoughts. It is a psychic-feeling-energy-battery existing in a parallel dimension. An example would be like playing a character in a video game. You can play the character through inputs sent via the controller or keyboard, but you are not \"physically\" there in the game.",

    "Answer": "As you can see with my previous response, the answer is yes, you are. Try to think less. True Void Meditation has no thinking/affirmations involved. It's a process of letting go. It takes time; years to truly master, but can be sped up through will and determination. As with \"healing\" - be careful, especially with consumerist spirituality. A lot of this is designed to keep you coming back for more. True healing involves the following:\n- Understanding your psychology and why you operate the way you do- Understanding some degree of sociology- Investigating childhood broken securities and mending them in adult form- Shrinking the inner critic (Google it)- Seeking to know truth over delusion\nIt involves practical, grounded steps before getting to the 'spiritual.' This is something many in the spiritualist and esoteric communities blatantly ignore, which is why many of them are stuck with mental illness. Pair this on top of ego and self-defensive mechanisms via protectionism, many won't get past this. I have to stress how important it is for adequate mental and emotional health. I wouldn't recommend any form of telepathy or any higher spiritual consciousness unless you secure these factors first.

    "Answer": "What I can tell you about these drones is that they are linked to an underwater base that creates these crafts. They aren't \"ET\" in the sense of being created in outer space, but they are created by ET forces. They are a part of waking mankind up, yes.",

    "Answer": "No. They have devices that can monitor, pick up, and transmit frequencies. They are very preoccupied trying to keep the world from blowing itself up, so they aren't \"play things\" to summon at whim. If one's telepathy is developed enough, it can penetrate their 'space' and systems. This is not recommended, which is why telepathic training and practice must be carried out, along with the proper education, including in morality and universal (not worldly) ethics. However, if the consciousness is advanced enough, it can \"bridge\" a gap between space and time, communicating with them in a relative future and past - which they can receive at that time/space. In this regard, you can communicate with them in other \"times\" and telepathic messages can be stored in pockets of spacetime, which they can access and transmit back to your current 'present.' Most of them are using machines to translate telepathy. They do not speak your language. You are intuitive, I know you'll understand what I mean.",

    "Tags": "Free Will, Past / Present / Future",
    "Question": "That being said I'm curious to know where free will plays a part in all this, essentially do humans have free will? As if time only exists linearly for humans (through the human perspective), the future has already been established essentially, so how would this tie in to us having or not having free will?",
    "Answer": "The answer to this question is manifold, so let's take our time to get into it.\n1 - Free will is both available yet limited at the same time. Let's put it like this: there's an end destination to reach to, but instead of going one specific path, you can take alternative for greater efficiency. However, no matter how many ripples a stone causes as it's tossed into the pond, it ALWAYS will flow downstream. So, it is not an excuse to do nothing. On the contrary, it means that one must act because free will allows the master plan or destination to be better executed. For example, let's say the original plan was a path that went through corridors A,B,C,D,E but we discover that going from A,C,Y,X is more efficient. Free will improves upon the 'grand system' but it doesn't break it. In other words, free will remains important so long as it is synced to your spirit which is synced to the GCS. You can be fed data directly and find out how to better alter your path toward it.\n2 - The \"present\" is important, as it experiences causality in the traditional sense, but it also experiences the past into the present (memories; inverse causality) and not only the present into the future (vision; forward causality.) The present is an aspect of singularity in the sense that it meets both past and future together to create the now. So, what one does in the \"now\" affects what they were in the past (e.g., let's say your journey was incomplete with your struggles but then you push yourself to complete it in the future -thereby making your past validated) and what they shall be in the future.",

    "Question": "Also what role do dreams play in all this? Would love to hear your thoughts",
    "Answer": "Dreams are the unconscious and subconscious processing. It uses random bits of your consciousness data to sift through background running processes of the mind; hence imagery can be rather strange and make no immediate tangible sense. If attuned and trained enough, especially if no predominant mental illnesses are present, then one can use symbolism and intuition to interpret the dream. In this respect, a visionary dream will have an attachment to the intuition and \"impulse\" the person to investigate as opposed to regular unconscious processing. Again, meditation is key, as it helps one to better adjust to conscious-unconscious processing. Eventually, a person can attain a degree of conscious-awareness unconsciously from continued meditation practices.",

According to them, love is the 'soul' of the GCS itself; it apparently is spiritual force itself which is not just life-enabling force, but existence-enabling. I still do not fully comprehend this myself. NHI have a much higher capacity for love than you can possibly imagine. My up-close encounter with them back in 2010 left practically a heavenly, euphoric feeling. I didn't want to leave their presence. It was difficult to re-adjust afterward. Still is to this day. That love changes you. Jake Barber is the real deal when he speaks about the love and the 'spirit of god' he felt. The attacks on him is because he's presenting legit information.",

    "Question": "Thank you for your fascinating perspective. Big picture question: Many of us were awoken in 2021, what was the physical mechanism that caused this? More personal question: what is different about future possibilities for awakened versus not? Is there a different trajectory?",
    "Answer": "Awakening\" (as you call it) is inevitable. There are certain actions in the present that can speed up this process such as more and more people coming together to think about higher truths, reality, what's really going on etc. - which all pull the future into the now. In the future, at the very end of time - as re-integration into the GCS - there's no such thing as \"lies\" but only being-existence. In this respect, truth is tied to evolution and thus, it's evolutionary as a whole. Nature doesn't have \"lies\" any more than optical illusions (e.g., gravitational lensing) that we come to realize what's really going on eventually. Think about it like this: what cannot survive truth goes extinct and what's in the dark, must come to the light. Sentience in general aren't built to lie. They may fool each other for some time, but inevitably, the 'dam' so to speak - breaks. Since 2010, there has been a massive 'speed up' and dates such as 2021, 2024, 2025 etc., are tied to this 'dam' breaking.",

    "Question": "I came across the quantum concept of “Planck lengths” in my very basic studies of quantum physics. Does this have anything to do with the GCS? Is this the GCS?",
    "Answer": "Planck length is only a measure of the unit; it's not exactly the GCS. Picture it like this: The GCS is operating in a sub-sub-sub-subspace between subspaces. Subspaces are so \"tiny\" that they can \"penetrate\" local classical reality you can perceive. These \"tiny\" quantum \"wormholes\" are infinite in their number, so they can practically build another space in/around/over/above/through traditional 3/4/5D space. There are higher spaces than even 11, 22, and 33. I am not even certain of the exact number - what you need to know is that these \"tiny subspace wormholes\" transverse through traditional lower dimensions, such as the one you're familiar with where general and special relativity apply. However, these subspaces do not have distance as a measurement because unlike traditional local spacetime that you're familiar with, which is limited, and thus, can be calculated - and therefore - measured - which amounts to speed limits, distance etc.; these subspaces, essentially, \"hyperspaces\" are \"null\" spaces. In other words, they are spatially infinite and if there is infinity, then relativity does not apply within that space. If space is stretched infinitely in all directions, then time cannot exist as linear causality. This is why/how the GCS can \"move between all spaces, times and dimensions\" instantaneously within its null-spacetime domain while we, in our traditional local spacetimes and classical reality, experience causality at a much slower rate.",

That I am certain sound crazy if spoken aloud. And I was really shocked to find a lot of these things are here in this post. The information, some detailed and some very broad and vague seemed to just appear in my mind, as fact. I don't really know how to describe it. But it was like suddenly a narrative was just uploaded into my brain. My thoughts \"sounded \" like my inner monologue. Every time I think about it or access that information I get overwhelmed emotionally, I cry, my heart races, and I get goosebumps all over(happening right now).",
    "Answer": "Yes, it was. It's by no coincidence you came to this thread and my \"friends from above\" pushed me to create it. This is part of the feedback-loop. I cannot reveal everything (yet) but what I can tell you is this:\n1 - You are not crazy, telepathy uses \"inner monologue\" because we are all connected/all one. We can \"tap\" into each other, which is why meditation and understanding YOUR identity/self versus being a subject of external-internalization is key. I have to be careful how much I reveal about this.\n2 - Telepathy can be 'saved' in 'spacetime pockets' so to speak. You (like many others in this thread both now and to come, along with the 'ideas' those here will spread to others who won't even see this thread) are part of a larger 'movement' in 'awakening' earth.\n3 - Telepathic information, as previously said, can be 'saved' in pockets. If accessed, it can be overwhelming, especially if the mind is untrained to handle it. You need to take your time. Do not rush the process and do not discuss it with others who aren't ready, nor try to convince, nor showboat your potency. I wish you luck. You're already on the right path.

    "Question": "I’d be very interested to know your thoughts on astral projection? The entities that one meets there, what do you think they are if anything?",
    "Answer": "Astral projection and remote viewing are very similar. The difference is that astral projection (if you wish to call it that) is a temporal displacement of the consciousness to connect to another region of space and time. Remote viewing is similar in this regard but usually more trained to maintain the connection to the physical body. Seeing 'entities' via either of these forms can mean the following:\n1 - Temporal view. Keep in mind that time is not linear to your present when your consciousness travels distances. You can be seeing the past or future and beings present there.\n2 - Interdimensional view. You can be seeing into other dimensions and again, spacetime relativity applies due to distance.\n3 - Immediate view. This is not always guaranteed again because of distance and usually only applies to shorter distances.\nA certain degree of the imagination is stimulated, which is why some people can be delusional from these claims. However, the imagination is only \"trying to simulate\" what it is experiencing because the consciousness lacks the necessary data for who/what/where it is connecting to. Therefore, it has to 'imagine' to a certain degree (sort of like how you'd imagine manifesting something, but it is slightly different in person when it comes etc.) in order to make sense of what it is perceiving. In some cases, it can be 'beings' whereas in others, it can be seeing another spacetime, dimension, place, etc.",

    "Question": "Just for clarification, in point 1 is the end point something more like this person will achieve certain things in their material life or is it more towards the spiritual like this person will be able to communicate telepathically eventually? Or are end points the death of each individual? Could you possibly give an example of an end point",
    "Answer": "1 - There are relative end points. End of a goal (e.g., getting a dream job, becoming more telepathic, law of attraction goal complete etc.) end of a journey, end of a chapter, end of an era, end of a year, death, and then there's the \"ultimate end\" at the \"end of time\" which is a \"re-integration\" into the GCS. Ironically, the GCS doesn't even \"end\" there either. Apparently, it keeps going even after the \"ultimate end\" into a new phase/simulation. Even NHI are still wrapping their heads around this. Also, regarding 'death' - well, I think you get the obvious by now.\n2 - Death is not an \"end\" either, as you will \"reincarnate.\" The only \"individuality\" lost is a \"moment in time.\" Remember my example with the table and Home Depot? Well, a table isn't a table (as an \"individual distinction\") until you assemble it, which requires time to literally do so. Before that, it's just \"parts in a box.\" The same applies to you. The \"individuum\" of \"time\" you can consider to be your \"individuality\" is an \"assembly\" of space and time. Thus, the true \"individual\" is simultaneously everything that created it/was it/will be it (e.g., genes from your parents, atoms, oxygen, 'we're all stars' etc.)\n3- As another poster asked me re. what parts I have not figured out in the puzzle - it's the \"ultimate end goal\" which, as I type this, I realize my \"human-3D brain\" just has difficulty accepting the true nature of reality as an eternity stretched in all directions exponentially, and not a strict linearity. The GCS just somehow continues expanding through past, present and future without any true apparent \"end,\" only relative \"pit stops.\" Good luck understanding this, I'd love to hear your own thoughts too.",

    "Question": "If the GCS is the central singularity connecting all spaces and times, how does it reconcile or manage the apparent chaos and randomness within individual universes or timelines?",
    "Answer": "There’s a “purification” process or “data refinement” process before it reaches the GCS. There are several layers or “filters” data passes through before it reaches the GCS, which is at such a “high purity” (so to speak) that the data passing through it must “comply” to its “wavelength.” The energetic state of the GCS, from our point of view, is seemingly “holographic” and massless, yet it “inputs” what you can discern as “unalterable” “commands” to all proceeding layers that even “higher beings” beyond physical spacetime cannot “override.”",

    "Question": "How do the laws of physics, as we understand them, arise from or align with the underlying nature of the GCS, and are they truly universal across all dimensions and realities?",
    "Answer": "The laws of physics are relative based the position of space and the position of space is based on the flow of its time. Since space can be warped, time can too. Remember how Newton assumed that time is absolute across the cosmos, then Einstein, seemingly, a heretic at the time, presumed the opposite? The same applies here, even for Einstein’s relativity which is not absolute for ALL space and time, only localities. The human race has to move past their absolutist nature, which is deeply encouraged from religion and cults, and affects even science to this day.",

    "Question": "In your understanding, what is the mechanism by which consciousness interfaces with spacetime? Does it operate as a wave, particle, or something beyond our current scientific models?",
    "Answer": "Particles and waves are actually intermixed on a quantum level, so the answer is both. The brain contains electromagnetic fields, and consciousness exists on this field in the quantum realm in an adjacent dimension. It is a series of quantum-interconnected waves that, on a larger “particle” scale, eventually animates/interacts with electromagnetism and by extension, particles such as photons, amongst others. Very basic, simple example whilst skipping many parts: GCS->(Countless “filter layers”)->Spirit->Consciousness-o-Mind->Physicality.",

I tend to believe that experience is what expands consciousness, which contributes to and expands the ultimate \"intelligent infinity\". Curious your take on this.",
    "Answer": "Your thoughts are more or less on the right track. Basically, individuum as a sole unit is an “aspect” or “mini-GCS” of its own. Everything is contributing in some way or another to the collective whole, almost like a hivemind with “singularity” points. Picture it like a developer who, instead of manually using search engines to educate himself on a topic, deploys multiple bots to fetch data. It’s much more efficient, less time consuming, and eventually brings more accurate knowledge to what that person is seeking. Another example would be with a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy that both holds and sustains a galaxy, yet, from time to time, stars, gasses, debris etc., fall into the black hole, stimulates it, and the black hole “burps” that matter/data/energy back – leading to either new star formation or galactic regulation.",

    "Question": "What insights have you gained about the relationship between consciousness and entropy? Could heightened awareness reduce entropy within a given system or reality?",
    "Answer": "Correct. Heightened consciousness, as you describe it, would be a “spirit-mind and awareness that is increasingly ‘closer’ to the GCS.” In this regard, the “closer” one’s consciousness, and by extension, ‘spirit’ is to the GCS, the more it can draw upon the GCS’s “infinite nature” in the lower, “physical” realm. This can create a variety of effects, nearly too endless to list, but the obvious would be increased knowledge and awareness of reality, stability of mind, emotion, body, soul, better health, more “feats of greatness,” and seeming “superpowers” the average layman deems impossible. Many ‘gods’ in myth, who were mostly ETs, know of this and have done it, displaying these seemingly supernatural capabilities for primitive man. There’s nothing supernatural nor paranormal about it, however. Also, there are limits of course because physical existence is at a very “low” stage of total cosmic-universal and multiversal evolution, let alone the GCS itself.",

Simply put, we are a byproduct of the simulation, and thus, bound to it, but we are also “programmed” to expand upon it “within its parameters.” This is both a failsafe against the GCS destroying itself and its “lower forms” (such as physical life) getting out of hand. Picture it like an MMORPG. You can play a class like a warrior or mage, and you can be much better than the average layman if you put effort into it – making what is seemingly “impossible” to the doubter, possible through you.

    "Answer": "“Suffering” is temporal and is mostly related to the lower physical dimensions. The higher the evolution, the less the suffering on grander scales. Keep in mind this does not apply to emotions and psychic feeling. These are multiplied tremendously, which is why higher beings very rarely interact with lower life. They can be tremendously “hurt” and “horrified” by what lower and more primitive life forms do, but this suffering they experience can be nullified rather easily. This also applies to “higher souls” or more “advanced spirits” or “future-pulled spirits” existing in a lower spacetime dimension. It is extremely troubling to them, which is perhaps why the so-called “starseeds” suffer greatly on earth and are confused why they are even here.",

    "Question": "If soul energy can ripple across dimensions, are there practical actions (aside from the core principal of embodying love) that individuals can take to ensure their contributions are constructive rather than harmful? Not sure I'm wording this right, but whenever my answer to a situation is \"love\" I feel that it's shrugged off and ignored as being too generalized and fluffy. Trying to think of other ways to engage in these situations.",
    "Answer": "Personally, I tend to agree with you that “love” – at least the word and the general reception of it – has been sullied, greatly. Love itself is not simply affection, nor white-robe cultist delusions. It’s certainly not ‘being crazy’ either or overstimulated. It’s a “primordial existence-enabling force.” Pay attention to this. Love ‘creates’ existence. It applies not just for physical beings but for seemingly “inanimate” objects like rocks, gasses, dust and so on. According to NHI, these somehow exist because of love. Some other examples are such as one can “love” their career and give all their “power” (love) to it – and thus, achieve great results. This even applies to “love” of evil (e.g., “love” to create weapons) – which will manifest itself to the one putting out that “love.” Of course, evil eventually destroys itself which is apparently some sort of “cosmic” or GCS law as one nears “the end of time.” NHI are very insistent that I impart this message of “love.” There’s a lot more to it. They said you should refer to Amelia Brand’s quote on love from Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. “Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it.”",

Ra and other channels/sources I've read mention various \"densities\" of existence that answer this, but i'm curious what your thoughts are on it.",
    "Answer": "Their perception of time is similar to mine in the sense that it transverses in multiple directions and the effects of one point in time, affects another. This was, at first, difficult for my “human-3D” brain to accept, but the more you understand that every “event” which includes actions – ripples outward throughout space – and thus – time, then the more you can be attuned to it. Our clocks we are used to is only a measurement of locality, but locality, as the word implies, does not apply to the gross interstellar. A simple example would be with timezones. If a person in Australia is communicating with you in America, then the present for you is a 12–20-hour difference. Your present versus theirs is different, yet the same. Why? Because you’re in different locations. This is how it works on a cosmic scale with distance creating more and more relativistic effects. Yet, your PRESENT can connect with the person’s PRESENT in Australia and somehow, you are in different times. Think about this very carefully, especially concerning computing and internet technologies along with the upcoming quantum computing being gradually available to the public. Now, think about it if you had to ‘send a letter’ across the seas to your friend in Australia versus messaging them online. Starting to get it?",

    "Answer": "Yes and no. It cannot be accessed directly consciously, but subconsciously, which can then be “translated” into conscious perception. As a rule of thumb, the higher the consciousness/spirit/closeness to the GCS, the greater one’s aptitude to “access” this data. It’s much more than just past or future lives.

So, if there is a “pollution” that is “preventing the flow” at the top, then “forces up top,” come to deal with it so the “dam can break.” On earth, there’s what you can describe as a “spiritual stifling” which is affecting the mass consciousness. Since everything is interconnected, what happens here is affecting “elsewhere” and these “elsewhere” places and their “inhabitants” aren’t particularly happy about it. However, this works in the positive too. Since everything and everyone at all times and spaces are drawing and sharing data across the GCS “network” we are also receiving natural evolutive-data to push mankind forward.

Sometimes they might \"barge\" in with particular \"quotes\" or specifics I should say, which I usually make known, but for the most part, they trust me to impart the knowledge. You have to keep in mind I've been prepared for this role for nearly three decades. My contacts reach me via secluded telepathy and the occasional up-close encounter. It's full-on conversations/dialogue. Since I \"blend\" into the public, the average person wouldn't recognize me beside \"feeling\" an energy that, to them, can invoke feelings of higher \"love/truth/energy expansion\" - but sometimes, this can create insecurities in the person if I do not shield the magnetic reach of my telepathy. I've been called a god, an angel, and other titles, which is precisely why I am hiding my identity because I want to \"blend in\" without any worship or praise. I do not want any cult following nor do I wish to be known outside the pseudonym I will use to disclose relevant information. My message is important, not me. As far as the telepathy goes, you must understand it works like this: What one has within the consciousness is what the outer telepathic connection (including regular people, btw) connecting to you can utilize to \"send information.\" If the consciousness is limited; lacking the necessary data etc., then the telepathic exchange can be confused, misinterpreted, and outright false. That's why these roles take decades to adequately step into and they require a lifetime of dedication to said missions. It's extremely frustrating to say at the least, especially when you do not want to put your loved ones at risk. There is much that you have to keep from them for their own safety. Do not trust \"contactees\" who are eager to spread their name, face, and image. These are usually dead giveaways of fakers, liars, hoaxers, frauds, grifters, and thieves. True telepathic contactees will most likely want to remain anonymous.",

    "Question": "Who are the Greys and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Mantids and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Reptilians and why are they engaging with humanity? Who are the Nordic beings and why are they engaging with humanity? Why are experiencers interacting with beings of such appearances the most?",
    "Answer": "I had to directly consult my contacts before answering this question because it is extremely dangerous to post this information publicly at this time. What I am allowed to say is this: most of these ideas of ETs such as “Nordic” aliens, including Pleiadians, and also, “Plejaren,” along with many other “visual concepts of aliens” are not their actual likeliness, name, nor their appearance. These are either straight up frauds or “imaginative reaches” from contactees in most cases with very, very, very few exceptions of truth. Sometimes, a person can connect or pull “data” from the soul-matrix-mass-consciousness, which is also called “Akashic records” among other mystical and esoteric names. Any ET/NHI arriving or on earth can have bits of their “data” – including “ideas” of their appearances, motives etc., pulled from this interconnected soul-consciousness-matrix and unconsciously grasped, then “translated” in the connecting person’s consciousness using the information/awareness/data/knowledge in that person’s awareness. This is how some writers can naturally come up with ideas for aliens (e.g., Star Trek, Mass Effect and so on). If the person’s mind is favored or biased in a certain direction, or in the case with religious people, can only think that ETs are strictly angels or demons – then they will project this idea onto the ETs/NHI and see them as such (e.g., Mothman “prophecies”). In several cases, ETs allow this because if the public were to know of their real appearances, it can create telepathic links that can negatively affect them. This is also why phones cannot take clear photos/videos of UFOs/UAP etc., as is the case with aliens even if they were in front of you because they are purposely using electromagnetic distortion via apparatuses. Admiral Byrd’s encounter with “Nazi aliens” is an example of his own projection. Since, at the time, there was much paranoia, fear, hatred and mistrust of Nazis and Germany in general, he projected this image when he encountered the beings there because of fear of the unknown. That is all I can disclose about his encounter. Now, regarding the so-called “Nordics” which is not a term I’d ever use – there are “human-looking” ETs and some of them have European-Scandinavian-like features, but there are also members of this group who are “colored,” which would be a shocker for the racists and white supremacists who are projecting their own biases onto real ET/NHI. This may sound harsh, and it is no offense to any of the good people there, but you need to be very careful with any German-related information regarding ETs, especially from Switzerland. The latter country in particular is filled with much evil and is host to thousands of cults that are contributing toward very negative and dark influence that real ETs, particularly the good ones, are VERY, VERY upset about. I will not mention the name of any particular group, but as a rule of thumb, you shouldn’t trust any information coming from Switzerland regarding ETs. Concerning greys and the “mantids” as you call them, they exist. Some are capable of shapeshifting; others can use technology to influence your mind to see them as human-looking or something else altogether. I am not allowed to speak of what you describe as “reptilians.”",

For example, I mentioned Germany above, but do you believe that every person in Nazi Germany during WW2 was evil? There were some German patriots who couldn’t stand what Hitler, and the Nazi regime were doing and wanted to stand up to it, such as the case with operation Valkyrie. This is also happening with some NHI/ET groups on earth, though most groups keep to themselves. Not each and every single one of them because they belonged to a particular faction are outright evil nor pledge their allegiance to their original group, federation, or world. “Higher beings” who are beyond physical spacetime have no allegiance to any group except for “keeping things in order” for the GCS at “the end of time.” NHI/ET dabbling here on earth has “messed up” things in other parts of the interconnected “grand cosmos” and some of these “higher beings” and forces are not pleased with the consequences of ET/NHI actions on earth.",

    "Question": "Why are many experiencers also able to engage with beings that appear to represent themselves as deities, goddesses and other such mythological entities. Where do these beings fit in with the more traditional \"ET\" like NHI?",
    "Answer": "The reply above should be sufficient re. the groups you asked of. What I’ll add is this: sometimes ET/NHI can only connect with what is “acceptable” to the person’s mind. Some groups will not force themselves and their true nature onto the person. They’ll allow them to perceive within the relativity of what is acceptable to the person’s consciousness. This is largely in part due to the matrix “bubble” we grow up in here on earth that makes it extremely difficult for the average person to accept truths outside what they’ve been taught. Contactees are no exception to this rule, as most of them are still fearful and uncertain. Understandably so. Contactees walk the uncomfortable line between “two worlds” and many of them can be driven to alienation, madness, depression, and other mental illnesses as a result, especially when society stigmatizes them. This makes it even more difficult for contactees to properly understand who/what is contacting them and their true nature. This is why I stress the importance of adequate mental stability, emotional health, physical well-being and spiritual soundness, which is why I strongly recommend meditation, especially for contactees, who, more than the average person, need to be very, very, very careful with the “energy” they are sending and receiving via all inputs/outputs.",

    "Question": "Which specific group of NHI are you in contact with and what exactly do they look like?",
    "Answer": "Groups operate by region. There are different groups and their allies operating in Europe, North America, South America, Russia, China, Japan, Australia & New Zealand, along with other continents, including Antarctica and the Arctic. They are not always “flying around” to say “hi” and have conversation. Most are leaving phased or cloaked devices (e.g., the ‘orbs’) to “pick up” on relevant data, not just about “contactees,” who can be prone to a special-syndrome complex; thinking everything is about them, but on other important data such as biometrics, regional stability, weather, general health of a population, soul-energy, and more. Most ET/NHI are not concerned with contacting people as much as believers and contactees assume. There are far more important tasks. The good ones are concerned with WMDs, nuclear warfare, international tension, the weapons industry, radiation leaks, and other hazards and conflicts to mankind, including cult and religious power over the soul. I have to be very careful with how I say what comes next because it can reveal my location, which I am not willing to do. I’ll say this: some NHI/ET operate in compartmentalized groups who share intel with each other. I’ve recently been transferred from one contact group to another because of “changing” my location. These groups are working together. The main ones I work with which I can reveal to you are a mixture of “tall greys/mantids” (if you wish to call them that) and the human-looking ETs that I wouldn’t recommend calling “Nordics.” Some are working together, amongst other races that I have not personally contacted. What you also need to understand is this: contactees can be in extreme danger with the information they are giving out, especially if your identity can be traced. As I said above, I am not willing to put either of us (and others) at risk for internet curiosity because it’s also not my mission as a ground agent. My task is to elevate the consciousness of mankind in preparation for upcoming events, which I can do without even citing my connection to my “friends from above.”",

    "Question": "I don't understand what you mean when you say NHI talk about us all being one connected to one ultimate God/GCS when you also state that NHI encourage a pantheistic view of god?",
    "Answer": "/ˌpæn.θiˈɪs.tɪk/ (also pantheist) showing or holding a belief in many or all gods, or the belief that God exists in, and is the same as, all things, animals, and people within the universe: the pantheistic religions of the world. The pantheistic approach to nature is that God is in everything.” Personally, I don’t really like to use the word ‘God’ as it gives the idea of a “person,” which is inherently wrong. Basically, all of us are “it” in the beginning of time as The Source energy itself, here in the now as a fragment, and then in the future as The Source once more. We are The Creator and co-creators at the same time. Baruch Spinoza has some rudimentary, yet solid ideas of this truth. The GCS is the “heart” or “singularity”-point of the ALL or ‘God.’ For reference, picture that your hands, arms, legs, feet, belly, etc., are all “part” of you and your brain is the central core that everything connects to. The GCS would be the ‘core’, but the other parts of the body are part/working with the GCS, so we can consider “one human” is the “sum of all their components.” This is the case for not just life, but literally EVERYTHING. Rocks, atoms, gasses, dust, water, “void-space”, quarks; EVERYTHING is ‘God’ (or a piece of ‘God’) or the ALL with the central singularity point being the most potent of them all.",

    "Question": "You have spoken about how people developing their consciousness and psi become more appealing to beings seemingly looking to absorb or utilize their emotional and sexual energy. I have seen this in my work and know some experiencers who have frozen in their development due to odd NHI activity in their home when in heightened emotional states and or sexual states which feels extremely intrusive and alarming for those in question. Even for people used to dealing with more intense levels of contact find this aspect of the phenomenon to be a roadblock. This does not happen for everyone but for those who do it blocks their development. I also know those who are highly gifted but pause on their development due to a desire to not have increased activity in their house as they have children and are highly protective. How did you overcome these factors to keep up with your own development? What advice would you give to experiencers who have paused in their journey due to these factors?",
    "Answer": "Well, this has to be a personal decision that we cannot and must not force – that is to say – if these individuals wish to continue their development and task. The truth is there is a “soul-feeding” going on, so to speak, and both human and ET/NHI can do this; sometimes accidentally (they are NOT perfect, they make a lot of mistakes), and in some cases, malevolent entities that are “leeching.” What I’d recommend is that the person has to decide for themselves if they wish to continue and come to terms with the fact that all contactees are in a soul-energetic trade whether they like it or not. Can this be invasive? Perhaps, but my personal belief is that this is a fear sprouted from our upbringings that do not teach us the true nature of reality. Simply put, everything is in a give/take exchange. It’s just the way it works. Contactees “pull” on ET/NHI as well, and this can be very draining to them, simply because of the difference of evolutionary levels. If you look at it from that perspective, is it fair that we are taking and never giving? Many of these ET/NHI are beings too. They are not invulnerable, nor unlimited. Think about this carefully.",

    "Question": "All distractions from what? Meditating 24/7 and nothing else?",
    "Answer": "It depends on the contactee’s level of spirit-consciousness development and their willingness to perform their task/role. The more of the demand of the task as a ground agent, the likelihood the necessity of developing and attuning skills, which includes A LOT of meditation, to say at the least. There’s no way around it, nor any shortcuts. I have been meditating for decades, with the past 15 years being anywhere between 10 to 15 hours per day of specific types of meditations to enhance my abilities for my tasks. To develop higher psi skills, better education, understand the true nature of reality and so on; it cannot come from being distracted/being consumed in the mirage of a “society” you live in. The more you consume yourself in the “ground level” society our families, friends, etc. live in (who aren’t connected to contactee tasks), and their intrigues (e.g., social media influence), the more your potency drops. This is how it works. That is why it is so difficult and why many people cannot begin to comprehend how truly life-consuming and lonesome being a ‘contactee’ really is. A lot of people are in this just to be entertained or to promote their image. That is why there are levels of contactees and most are contacted unconsciously because they are unwilling to give up their ‘ground-level’ lives and the belief systems connected therein. Understandably so, since it is extremely frustrating and difficult to be a contactee in a world that lives in lies and delusion when you’re being that bridge for truth and bringing forth a higher reality. The higher the potency of the contactee, the more the isolation, even when you “blend into” society and are surrounded by loving family and friends.",

    "Question": "While I think I get more of what you are trying to say here I don't vibe with a lot of your example. We are a social species and we learn and develop and grow from our interactions with one another. Creativity and coming together as part of a social group \"Parties/video games\" etc can and do have spiritually elevating qualities to them. Of course intent and set and setting applies. My own NHI have been extremely responsive to me gather groups of experiencers into social settings to talk share grow and bond. But have also encouraged me to not forget about family get togethers and see an importance there too. I have done support calls with experiencers while both of us were playing minecraft together. Which was heavily appreciated by both the experiencers personal NHI contact and my own beings. Indeed my ability to heal others via social settings and creating social environments where people gather as groups and talk from the heart while also have fun seems to be something that is considered highly valuable by a number of NHI beings I've come across as well as my own.",
    "Answer": "As pointed out yesterday, there was a misunderstanding. Hopefully, my response above would already begin to clarify. However, I’d like to address specific topics you mentioned here more directly. First, creativity and art, such as music, literature, video games, movies/cinema, among others, are VERY, VERY, VERY good. Christopher Nolan’s works are exceptionally elevating to the consciousness, among others like the game Spore, and in some cases, Second Life, though it can be used wrongly and indulged in escapism. The intent matters greatly. All things in moderation. You should be aware that I was a professional gamer and was sponsored to compete at a high tier level. The amount of hand-eye-coordination to neuroplasticity is nothing short of electrifying and stimulating to the consciousness. The same applies to good, harmonic music, and not music blasting lyrics about drugs, violence, over-sexuality, darkness, death, and the discordant “harmonics” associated therein. Same applies to movies, TV shows and the like, along with pornography designed to create shock and awe such as Game of Thrones. All this stimulates the soul field in many ways than you may assume, which I can get into, if you wish. Now, regarding your specific connections with family and friends – I believe this is your task and I encourage you to continue it. All contactees aren’t here for the same missions. I am at a level that I can no longer be among crowds very much any longer, even friends and family whom I love dearly. Their wavelengths are too “in the system” and it creates more damage to me – as naturally – whether you like it or not, we are ALL exchanging soul-energy; hence the feedback-loop. The higher the developed the lifeform/consciousness, the more you will be drained because like a parent, you are giving more to the child than visa versa. I’ve also been in various teams, and even led a community of advanced individuals, so I am well aware of the “healing effect” you mentioned and the exchange of energy. However, for me, I went “too far” ahead (which was necessary for my task) and the “exchange” became too tilted that I was drained even without my loved ones, friends, etc., wishing to do so. Your NHI contacts encourage you to do so because that is part of your mission which I am also encouraging you to continue doing. The world needs contactees like yourself just as much as it needs the extremely rare ones like me, who have a very specific purpose with serious, life-altering demands. I cannot work a “regular job” and I am sponsored by certain parties who are well aware of my abilities. What I’ll also say is this: that ‘thing’ I asked for had to do with a loved one. That loved one is the only one capable of giving me the feedback-loop I need that allows me to continue my task while blending into society as a supposed “normie.”",

    "Question": "Do you have any other guidance for an ordinary confused person such as myself?",
    "Answer": "First of all, I want to say that I understand and relate to the mixed emotions, confusion, fear, and excitement you are experiencing. There is so much misinformation out there, which is why in terms of materials, I can only recommend that book coming from J/R. There are of course some decent recommendations, like some Hemi-Sync, binaural beats, Source Vibrations (YT it), among others. Meditation is truly key. What I'd add as well to your list is the following:\nAvoid both love-bombing and logic-bombing; these are tell-tale signs that something is off\nLove is more than just affection - it's the \"soul-force\" of the GCS and everything connected to it. One must employ themselves to study it for their entire lifetimes and then some.\nOn that note, educate yourself in various topics. Some I'd recommend are astronomy, physics, psychology, sociology, epistemology as a whole, linguistics, philosophy, theology, medicine, health, technology (especially emerging technology) and pay attention to current world events.\nHowever, do not get \"sucked\" into politics. Avoid both left and right. They are both part of the \"system.\"\nAvoid media of all kinds that are discordant, promoting shock and awe, and are psychically disturbing.\nSex is sacred, but pornography, isn't.\nAlways question people's motives, but also, question your own and why you are asking what you're asking - is it coming from insecurity? Are you challenged? Do you genuinely care? This is extremely difficult for most people to confront themselves.\nSincerity of questioning is absolutely crucial to intent.\nHealthy critical thinking, not nihilism disguised as criticism and \"constructive feedback.\" Healthy critical thinking means you have to also think critically that \"my systematic ideas, beliefs, and upbringing do not hold the keys to all universal truth.\" Because they don't. Remember this.\nHuman fallibility is not an excuse not to try nor to have some faith in human knowledge. One must find balance to know what is true.\nYou can better do this by TRUSTING YOUR INTUITION.\nYou can do that by CLEARING YOUR MIND and listening to the FEELING, which isn't and can never be the same as the logical-intellectual brain - which, while it does have its uses, is not the entirety of one's mind nor consciousness.\nAvoid all UFO cults, especially those that promote some sort of prophet \"of the new age\" or messiah, or reincarnation of religious figures. Reincarnation is more complex than a single \"soul\" reincarnating. I can get into this, if need be, but this is your tell-tale sign that something is off.\nQuestion whistleblowers like Luis Elizondo, who isn't on the good side. He is a direct agent of chaotic disclosure, among others. Anyone who is supporting militant aggression toward ETs shouldn't be trusted. At all.\nYou can never have enough knowledge. Even for me and NHI, you have to be open to continue educating yourself further forever and be willing to abandon beliefs that no longer fit reality, no matter how much security you found in it.\n“If your belief conflicts with empirically confirmed knowledge, then you are not seeking meaning; you are delusional.” ― Sabine Hossenfelder\nIt's okay to have some beliefs and some security but be willing to trade them for truth.",

    "Answer": "P-A-T-I-E-N-C-E. Good things come to those who wait. It took me three, dedicated decades and giving up a normal life to attain these gifts and insights. It's not easy and it can be discouraging, lonesome, and painful.\nDon't be in a rush to \"catch up\" because of \"falling behind\" due to (whatever reason.)\nForgive yourself for whatever those reasons are.\nRushing can create over-expectations which lead to de-motivation and burnout.\nFor example, with meditation - don't try to do hours of meditation per day.\nFor most beginners and those who aren't in daily practice, I'd recommend no more than 3 to 5 minutes to start.\nFor daily practitioners who have been doing it for months to a couple years, then 20 minutes is enough.\nFor those with gifts who wish to expand their abilities must be willing to dedicate literal years and even certain sacrifices to attain their full potency and aptitude.\nSet reasonable goals and schedules and as you fulfill these, work your way up.\nCelebrate the small victories because as you can see with all this discussion about the quantum realm - it's the small that makes up the big.\nBe okay with mistakes and fallibility. You are going to make them.\nPerfectionism is not okay, but human excellence, is.\nShrink your inner critic.\nKnow that you can. Don't believe it. Know it.",

    "Answer": "Yes, and it can reveal much truth, but I do not recommend any of it, including DMT, unless the mind is stable and the general mental health is sound. It should only be taken once in a blue moon - like once every few years, if to be taken, at all. For most people, I'd say do not take any psychedelics or drugs of any kind. My NHI contacts strongly discourage all drug usage, especially alcohol. They will pretty much never show up in-person if I am under any sort of influence and avoid contacting me when under these states both for verification of my information and my protection. All of my up-close, in-person encounters have been clean, completely sober, well-rested, and of sound mind. Weed is a psychic drug that can enhance telepathy and psychic capabilities, which is why you should avoid abusing it and using it around/with people of lower consciousness/stuck to the \"system.\" Moderation and once in a blue moon is fine akin to toasting a glass of champagne with friends and family.",

    "Question": "I have had experiences where it feels as though animals sense my shift in frequency. This question is coming from a place of never having researched psychedelics, never read any books about them or anything, only have had my own experiences. Two summers ago I had the most intense psychedelic experience of my life. I won’t go into it here, but it changed my life and rid me of the fear of death. At one point I zoomed out into space and felt myself flying around the planets, and had the “knowing” that when we die, we gain the ability to fly anywhere. This part of the trip was a blip on my way to “fully zooming out” before I eventually regained consciousness in my physical state. I was blacked out for almost the entirety of my trip. Thoughts or insight about this?",
    "Answer": "The consciousness is altered in these states, including the electromagnetic oscillations it gives off. Animals can pick up on this. Mushrooms allows one to quasi-access higher states of consciousness connected to the \"other side,\" which can amount to some truths, but as I must stress over and over again: do NOT take them unless you are of sound mind. Furthermore, do NOT abuse them. And for others reading - if you are too scared to get into it - then avoid it altogether. It's not necessary, though it can be used as an enhancer in the right hands. Again, for 99% of people out there, my recommendation is to avoid all drugs and psychedelics altogether as very, very few people can handle it.

If you are able/willing, could you expand on how certain knowledge is given to you in such a way that the giver provides strict instructions (as in this case) not to reveal it?

    "Answer": "About roughly 90% of what is given to me isn’t to be shared and is “stored” in my subconscious. It may seem ironic, but even after everything I shared, I am still withholding most of it and I am only willing to go so far to share certain information publicly. Some, I’d share privately or through other means. Other parts of this information, I will take to the grave with me. If you want a reference to how this works, see how John Crichton from Farscape had the “wormhole knowledge” stored in his subconscious by the “ancient aliens.” I’m not the only one who is like this. Several people are; unconsciously tapping into their subconscious data and the exchange of ideas via the consciousness-soul-matrix between groups, nations, planets, solar systems, galaxies, universes, multiverses and so on – all the way up to the GCS itself. The difference with myself (and a very few select individuals) is that I know how to access a portion of the data consciously. Sometimes my contacts directly tell me what not to share. Other times, I am too scared to share it, even if they push me. It’s a combination, based on the situation.",

They can “alter” or “manipulate” forces to a certain degree which does result in fairly alternative physics, but it cannot completely drift away from the “original source code.” Picture it like using Unreal Engine. You can build a game that looks completely different from another, but you are still bound, in some way or another, to the engine’s programming parameters. Apparently, sentient-created-universes tend to work the same way. This sort of advancement is rare with most ETs. It’s extremely high up there on the scale of sentient evolution and borders between transitions into non-physicality.",

I’ve already said some of which ones. Some Void Meditations I prefer absolute silence. When one meditates long enough, the entire life can, in a sense, be a “meditation” and this is when the real benefits of meditation come into play.

    "Question": "Could consciousness precede material reality as a mechanism for anchoring the GCS's infinite potential? I guess, if consciousness is the foundational reality, it implies that the material world arises as an expression or projection of this primal awareness. GCS, as infinite potential, would use consciousness as the medium through which its essence is explored and experienced. This suggests that physical forms and dimensions are not primary but rather serve as reflections of the singularity's will to know itself. Consciousness thus anchors infinite potential by creating structured experiences through layers of distortion...is that on the right track?",

    "Answer": "Your thoughts are more or less on the right track. It is both personal and impersonal, something neither New Age cultists nor religious extremists cannot seem to grasp. Not much a surprise with linear-thinking consciousness when the reality is that time is moving in ALL directions at once. Please, for anyone reading, pay attention to this. “According to the currently established laws of nature, the future, the present, and the past all exist in the same way. That's because, regardless of what you mean by 'exist', there is nothing in these laws that distinguishes one moment of time from any other. The past, therefore, exists in just the same way as the present. While the situation is not entirely settled, it seems that the laws of nature preserve information entirely, so all the details that make up you and the story of your grandmother's life are immortal.”\n― Sabine Hossenfelder.",

    "Answer": "Correct. Time is expanding in all directions at once. This is the actual correct, physics-based way of viewing time. Time as causal linearity is in “lower” spacetime dimensions paired with the perception of lower consciousness. In other words, the world you live in encourages linearity when in truth, it doesn’t precisely exist the way you assume as simply measurement based on your clocks and motion around the sun. These are, again, lower or “local” spacetime dimensions, but in reality, there are other spacetime dimensions moving through, in, around, over, up, and under.

    "Answer": "Yes, both through consciousness and technology. As a rule of thumb, the technology you’d describe as “time travel” is less “time travel” than “spacetime transversing.” Time is dependent on the position of space, so where one travels, the time adjusts accordingly. There are what you can describe as “pure energy spaces” in between traditional spacetimes as “hyperspaces” that, if the human enters without the appropriate technology, will become everything and anything – all and nothing – in all times and spaces. This would, of course, lead to an instantaneous death and re-integration into the GCS, only to be “spat” back out in another spacetime dimension. (Reincarnation)",

Keep in mind every universe, due to its sheer size, has so many “fractures” in spacetime that spatial dimensions can crisscross between each other, ‘penetrating’ each other’s space (once the right components of radiation and light meet), opening “natural portals to other dimensions.” Bermuda triangle had such a portal but has since been closed.",

In lower physicality, such as the case with mortal beings, the answer is – only subconsciously – with very few mortal beings able to access it consciously. Most of these mortal beings are usually assisted either by higher beings, technology, or a combination of both. The higher the evolution, as one “ascends” into higher states of being that no longer requires physicality, the more the “memory” comes back due to the infusion between past, present, and future (3-3-3). In the “great future” all memory is restored through re-integration with the GCS.",

    "Question": "How is new life created from a spiritual standpoint?",
    "Answer": "A “part” or “string-wave” of the interconnected-grand-soul is “imbued” into the being or thing, which is not always directly from the GCS, but “singularities” in between, including planetary spirit-singularities. Let me be very clear: it is not just “life” as in biological life, that have souls/spirit. EVERYTHING – literally rocks, gasses, clouds, dust, photons, atoms, quarks, space and time itself – bears a part of the grand-cosmic-soul. This can also be influenced by technology to artificially create or bring forth certain souls both in the past and future or other interconnected spacetimes that, from your point of view with linear causality, seemingly has no connection. In other words, it’s possible NHI can “pull” from their soul-matrix in their relative future/planet/spacetime dimension to imbue life in a human here on earth. This is what you could describe as a “earth human being born with an alien spirit.” Some religious figures, scientists, philosophers, actors, directors, writers, gamers, among others had/have/will have this soul type like Einstein, but most of them either had no idea, were assisted, went mad, became egoistic, or altogether, failed their mission. The one you call “Jesus” is an example of this process gone wrong and whoever claims to have any part of this “soul” or is a reincarnation of such, including changing the name to “Jmmanuel” among others – should not be trusted. Souls aren’t as “individual” as many would assume and are, in fact, an amalgamation of past, present, and future and of everything and everyone. If, in both distant past and future, all is one, then the individuality is only a moment in time and not an entirety. In other words, all soul-energy is interconnected, and call pull from different lifetimes that are seemingly not in their “line.” I can expand on this if need be.",

    "Question": "Are there NHI that select a drop of energy from the GCS to create a human soul? Or does energy naturally just flow into a fetus as it develops? Are our bodies basically just avatars?",
    "Answer": "All of the above. Not all NHI/ET can do this, however. Some aren’t as developed or educated in soul dynamics. Now that you mention the ‘avatar’ part, I can reveal a part of the information my contacts authorized, but only a fraction because it’s very dangerous to speak of this publicly. Let’s just say it’s possible for people to be ‘overridden’ by external forces/beings, including both NHI/ET and human alike, along with practically anything/everything. Humans, particularly those in power, and certain cult and religious groups are already doing this to your masses, especially celebrities and influencers, along with politicians and those in the military. The rule of thumb is the lower the spirit evolution, the easier the override. Since everything is interconnected on the soul-level, one can theoretically tap into another, become one, and even override them. This is the case with channeling, which is why I will not recommend it to 99.99% of the human population. I can’t get into too much detail of how this process works, but my NHI contacts have repeatedly told me that in the case with lower life and underdeveloped sentience, while they can “push inputs” into the person, insect/animal, or thing, it doesn’t mean they’ll understand it or immediately act upon it. Some would think it’s a message from angels, gods, or they’re simply hearing voices, or they’ll give all the credit to themselves as often the case with egoists. There’s a certain tracking with “demonic and angelic” possession, but not in a religious sense.",

There’s not going to be a time we ever fully understand it even in non-physicality, let alone mortality.

While there are some honest channelers, contactees, teachers, and guides, and while you can learn a great deal from them – including some of the channels and information I’ve mentioned previously, my contacts are insistent to wait on this J/R work because it’s apparently one of the few people they can truly trust to get out the information they need. There are others who are called to do this, and some do their part, but others are either too scared, misinterpret too much of the information (which is fine in small portions), become ridiculously egoistic and create cults and crab-in-the-bucket communities, or assassinated. Others refuse to “give up” their ground lives and despite contact, want to enable the current system or, in some cases, purposely feed some positive information whilst keeping their followers down to empower themselves. As such, the NHI collective on the ‘good side’ are very upset and untrusting of most of humanity and contactees. There are very few who are willing to put their egos, belief systems, securities etc. aside to do the right thing. Anyone who claims to be “the only contactee” of any type of ET group is your red flag they’re a hoaxer, fraud, liar and, according to ETs, “soul thief.” Furthermore, NHI do not recommend any “teaching” and request that those reading this should abandon them immediately.

To me, it's not really false, it's just that humans named their home Pleiades so to humans, they are called Pleiadians. I mean there's no harm in that, no? I assume you just meant that that's not what they call themselves (Lashae) and that more people should know and call them, and other ETs, by their true names, which I totally understand.",
    "Answer": "The real issue is that it can create cults, false misunderstandings, enable biases (especially racist and supremacist ones), and mislead people into thinking something else altogether, adding pollution to the soul field. Real ETs can be negatively affected by this to some degree, and they aren’t particularly happy about it. Especially this over-the-top imagery of Pleiadians as “light-beings” and “white robed” cosmic saviors, or in other cases, logic-driven, emotionally-lacking Spock characters from Star Trek in a galactic federation. This is not actually how they are in real life, and it can create warped beliefs as opposed to reality. While there are some truths between these lines, as they are more advanced and have access to higher knowledge of physics, reality, and philosophy, and while they are indeed more loving than earth people without being scolding, small-minded, and gossiping with “a one-and-only contactee,” they are very much human-like, fallible, and ultimately mortal. It’s not so much that using the wrong word is the problem. It’s the image or idea that many ‘contactees’ are putting out there, which is inherently misleading and false. Some of the members of this group have tried to contact people and they refused to accept it because it wasn’t the “image” of a blonde, blue-eyed, white, tall, perfect-looking human they were expecting.",

    "Question": "Regarding politics, you said to avoid both left and right as they're all part of the \"system\". What do you mean by that? Are you talking about in the grand scheme of things, that both sides are playing their roles so to speak? I do agree that it's a very good idea to not get into politics and that it's much more productive to focus on oneself, but it's also pretty clear now that there's spiritual warfare going on between good and evil here on Earth, and some level of awareness doesn't hurt at all. And Trump, you know he may not be perfect but he pretty much stands against the dark forces. For most people, he is a major catalyst for awakening, don't you think?",
    "Answer": "While I will refrain from giving my personal opinion about Trump, I will say that he was not so much evil as he was the “perfect American,” which is, culturally speaking, headstrong, ruthless, and determined to make his mark. You are right that his opponents did try to make him worse than he is, but he really isn’t that great either. I can’t encourage politics. It’s ultimately a distraction. You should only view politicians as “puppets” in the larger picture because they are. Trump’s “insertion” into the office (yet again) is deliberate to contain the world from imploding, but make no mistake, this is not any support of Republicans, nor the right, nor damnation of Democrats, and the left. All sides are corrupt beyond repair and part of the puppet orchestration. Trump himself isn’t even fully a Republican. He used that party for his aims.",

    "Question": "In relation to the binaural use with certain HZ, is there a preferred binaural frequency which works best, would 2 or 4 be best as it keeps the hz as close to its natural number as possible or. I come from a music production background and the journey I've taken in learning and releasing music made in a certain state has changed the way i think about the world and our unconscious connection to each other, hard to keep brief but I noticed a trend in the songs made through a state of deeper intuitive guidance are the ones which resonate with people more so, after a while of experimenting with this over many songs and years released worldwide, I could only conclude this were for good reason. Probably a stretch but on music have you heard of Aleksi Perälä and his Colundi Sequence work with very deliberate alternate/mirco tunings and his research behind a lot of what he does? More info on it within this interview and online https://ra.co/features/2567 and https://modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=271260, A larger chart of Hz can be found here https://ra.co/images/features/2015/aleksi-perala-colundi-numbers.jpg from the RA interview above. He is a bit elusive as an artist but there is something interesting going on with these micro tunings and scales which may cross over with some of these meditations HZ of note imo, many cross over with some of the hz you have mentioned, enough for this artists to abandon traditional music and to be ultra prolific with this series which has been ongoing for years now. Going to dive in the cymatic hz which impact water and have a play with some of these musically regardless :)",

    "Question": "I want to really thank you for clarifying how it really is with that group that may or may not live so far from the alps, the 'one and only contactee'. I fell in with them for several years and recently got myself away completely (began to separate myself a couple years ago from the group but still read the writings). Felt something was off at times but gave the benefit of the doubt. Glad to finally free from them. Thank you again :)",
    "Answer": "It's my pleasure. What you must understand is that person (BM) and his cult group (F) are known by real ETs very well. They despise him and his group, more than you can imagine. There are no ET/NHI assisting him, although he, like several other contactees around the world, were once attempted to be contacted/influenced. It should be clarified he had no actual physical contact with any ETs, nor consistent conscious-telepathy, only stored subconscious data and a sighting which he then ran with and created a cult to empower himself. This is another reason ETs are so infuriated with him and his group, among others, who also abused the potential bridges they were given. The beings on \"higher planes\" were so infuriated with him that they've \"altered the timeline\" to assure that neither he, nor any other cult group here and throughout the (entire cosmos) can ever amass even a droplet of soul-energy through such means. BM is very spiritually weak and was only empowered through his following's belief, although their 'teachings' pride themselves to not use this word 'believe', you can rest assured, it is belief-power, supplementing him and his collaborators. Many of the \"falsifications\" he insisted on were being created by supposed computer malfunctions were real ETs messing with his work to show the truth that they were stolen from other sources, namely religious and philosophical texts. However, he and his group are not the only ones, though they are among one of the worst offenders of recent soul leeching with cults. There are several other groups, including the \"Swiss UFO death cult\" back in the 90s that were notoriously out of control. Soul leeching can make even primitive lifeforms more powerful than they really are. However, you can rest assured that this is no longer an issue in the new time and never will be again.",

It’s not just NHI, humans can do this to humans as well, as can all life, including animals, and the like, and even nature can override you. Everything is interconnected, so it’s possible to tap into others. It’s not strictly about being underdeveloped. However, the less developed the mind/consciousness/spirit matrix, then the more prone one can be to both good and evil outer influences – but this isn’t strictly always a bad thing.

    "Answer": "Since psychosis quite literally means “losing contact with reality” and you are programmed to live in a false reality, then you can begin to comprehend that many false-positive diagnoses are designed to keep you living in its matrix. This isn’t to say all psychosis diagnoses are wrong, but it is especially applied to those who are breaking free of the delusional “system” we are indoctrinated to believe in. Violence is also a byproduct of the system because of poor upbringings, lack of foundational education, particularly in healthy morality and substantial ethics, among other influences such as media, collective beliefs, and more. Hearing voices can happen in some real cases of delusion, but many, in the case of telepathy, higher forces, connections etc., are false-positives that so-called “professionals” who are sleepers, tied to the “system” would have difficulty understanding anything outside it. As such, they, out of sheer ignorance, arrogance, and their own fears of losing faith in their “systematic beliefs” (which includes even making money from it and status), would gaslight people who truly have abilities and experiences into conforming to their systematic dogma and limited beliefs.",

    "Question": "Physicist Nassim Haramein did a wonderful presentation on sacred geometry, where he theorized that the arc of the covenant may have actually been a large capacitor that could store immense energy, and “god” in the Hebrew bible, which resided in the arc of the covenant, was an advanced technology given to humans by a “sun god”. As he describes it, he believes that the biblical “god” or tetragrammaton is “like a little sun in a box, a singularity artificially-created inside a stone or crystal that contains plasma dynamics, spinning at high-angular velocity, generating a torque in space-time, producing gravitational effects and energy effects”. He goes on to theorize that the Egyptian Pyramids may have been where this object was kept, and they served as shielding devices or resonance cavities “resonating space-time in a very geometric structure”. According to Nassim, the measurements to build the arc of the covenant found in the bible fit perfectly into the sarcophagus at the center of the grand pyramid of Giza. So it’s possible that when Moses left Egypt with the Hebrews, he took with him this power source and used it to lead the hebrews through the desert for 40 years and part the Red Sea. The presentation itself is quite fascinating. Do you or your contacts have any opinions on this theory or its validity? Is the god in the bible a power source capable of anti-gravity?",
    "Answer": "Such technology most certainly exists and can still be found hidden in places today, although most of the gods, angels, demons, devils, and the like in myth and religion were either physical ET/NHI. Moses directly had contact with ET who led him, although he was not fully aware. The idea of ‘god as a power source’ according to my contacts, is correct, but it should not be looked at strictly as a device or apparatus. Rather, “the fabric of ALL [God] interconnected and interweaves all times and spaces in such a way that it can be drawn upon to create reality, which includes structures, objects, and what you’d deem as propulsion such as anti-gravity and electromagnetic-plasma infusion.”",

I used to think that if used correctly, humanity could adopt empathy and usher in a new era of peace, kindness, and advanced technology by tapping into dormant DNA or something of the sort. But I know first-hand how dangerous they can be.

    "Question": "In order to pull off the shadow-banning not just on Reddit but on other platforms…’they’ must have tremendous digital access/power/resources. It seems like that level of control far extends the reach and capabilities of moderators, and there has to be some sort of centralized (or at least, somewhat organized) group whose goal is to prevent this knowledge from being presented to the public. Governmental? Seems unlikely. Military? Maybe. I don’t know.",
    "Answer": "These groups themselves do not particularly belong to any specific govt/military/official organization. They are centralized in command but operate de-centralized for ground operations. It's more like \"moles\" within every major platform, group, military, govt, bipartisanship, cults, religions, and even social media platforms like Discord, Reddit, Skype, Guilded, Telegram, Slack, and the like. It's organized and they are able to contact each other within the space to connect the dots if certain keywords and patterns are used. They also use AI to assist them in doing this.",

    "Question": "Are your contacts the Anunnaki or somehow related to them?",
    "Answer": "The “Anunnaki” is largely a myth, but in a sense, you can say, yes. They fostered mankind and “bore a collective part” of their soul into humankind here.",

    "Question": "When I asked you about the moles on my face relating to my suspicion of having contact as a child, you replied with “3-3-3 Orion.” Are you able to expand on this answer, because I have Orion’s belt on the other side of my face, to the right of my right eye. But I did not tell you that. If you are not allowed to give me more information, could you point me in another direction to research? Thank you.",
    "Answer": "These are my contacts (and yours), and some of them come from what we would call Orion. Study this: http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/anasazi/time2007n.html I strongly suggest you read the latest articles “Message from Above” Part I and II. https://www.jrprudence.com/post/a-message-from-above and https://www.jrprudence.com/post/a-message-from-above-ii",

    "Question": "I’ve read other places about the possibility of a cataclysmic event this year. What are you hearing about that?",
    "Answer": "Every single piece of news, media, beliefs, ideas, rumors etc., speaking about “the end of the word” or some biblical level apocalypse should be immediately recognized as false. My contacts are the ones keeping the world from blowing up and they’ve been doing it longer than any of us were born. They’re very, very good at it. Ask yourself why, since WW2, have we not blown ourselves up? Our nuclear power has only magnified exponentially, and world leaders have only grown greedier and power hungry. Do you think it’s by coincidence? Anyone, especially UFO frauds, hoaxers, grifters and cultists who are always warning about the end of the world can automatically be known as fake liars and deceivers who are goading you on out of fear. Fearmongering is a tool of deceivers and hope dealers. Be aware. Same applies to any news broadcast of any kind of end of the world. Surely, things will get hot, but the world will never end through any sort of cataclysmic destruction. It will end like how all life does. Naturally and eventually, but never through any apocalyptic or dystopian future.",
